        "summary": "A new CRISPR breakthrough shows scientists can turn genes back on without cutting DNA, by removing chemical tags that act like molecular anchors. The work confirms these tags actively silence genes, settling a long-running scientific debate. This gentler form of gene editing could offer a safer way to treat Sickle Cell disease by reactivating a fetal blood gene. Researchers say it opens the door to powerful therapies with fewer unintended side effects.",

The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written.</p><p><span>type: <!-- -->embedded-entry-inline<!-- --> id: <!-- -->74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSl</span></p><p><a href=\"https://nousresearch.com/nouscoder-14b-a-competitive-olympiad-programming-model/\">NousCoder-14B</a> achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on <a href=\"https://livecodebench.github.io/\">LiveCodeBench v6</a>, a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba&#x27;s <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-14B\">Qwen3-14B</a>, according to Nous Research&#x27;s technical report published alongside the release.</p><p>&quot;I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1q2uuil/google_engineer_im_not_joking_and_this_isnt_funny/\">wrote Jaana Dogan</a>, a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt.</p><p>The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic&#x27;s <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/technology/the-creator-of-claude-code-just-revealed-his-workflow-and-developers-are\">Claude Code has captured imaginations</a> with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability.</p><hr /><h2><b>How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate</b></h2><p>What distinguishes the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/NousCoder-14B\">NousCoder-14B</a> release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/NousCoder-14B\">model weights</a> but the <a href=\"https://github.com/NousResearch/atropos/pull/296\">complete reinforcement learning environment</a>, benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company&#x27;s <a href=\"https://github.com/NousResearch/atropos/pull/296\">Atropos framework </a>— enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to <a href=\"https://wandb.ai/jli505/qwen14b/reports/HermesCoder-14B--VmlldzoxNTQ5Nzc0MQ?accessToken=4pt3stwyh4x83zqe2jgoo5j9b7j07jbe5omf2n40lray3tih17vfkavjootvnw8o\">reproduce or extend the work</a>.</p><p>&quot;Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research,&quot; <a href=\"https://x.com/o_mega___/status/2008907268700475450?s=20\">noted one observer on X</a>, summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities.</p><p>The model was trained by <a href=\"https://x.com/JoeLi5050\">Joe Li</a>, a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li&#x27;s <a href=\"https://nousresearch.com/nouscoder-14b-a-competitive-olympiad-programming-model/\">technical report </a>reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model&#x27;s improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance.</p><p>Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B&#x27;s improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days.</p><p>&quot;Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience,&quot; Li wrote in the technical report.</p><p>But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners.</p><hr /><h2><b>Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/NousCoder-14B\">NousCoder-14B</a>&#x27;s training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.</p><p>The approach relies on what researchers call &quot;verifiable rewards&quot; — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale.</p><p>Nous Research used <a href=\"https://modal.com/\">Modal</a>, a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively.</p><p>The training employed a technique called <a href=\"https://dapo-sia.github.io/\">DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization)</a>, which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves &quot;dynamic sampling&quot; — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning.</p><p>The researchers also adopted &quot;iterative context extension,&quot; first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent.</p><p>Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters.</p><hr /><h2><b>The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress</b></h2><p>Buried in Li&#x27;s <a href=\"https://nousresearch.com/nouscoder-14b-a-competitive-olympiad-programming-model/\">technical report</a> is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses &quot;a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format.&quot;</p><p>In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data.</p><p>&quot;The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude,&quot; Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. &quot;This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data.&quot;</p><p>This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is &quot;increasingly finite,&quot; as Li put it.</p><p>&quot;It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures,&quot; he concluded.</p><p>The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn&#x27;t — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult.</p><p>Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. &quot;Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction,&quot; he wrote.</p><hr /><h2><b>A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech</b></h2><p>Nous Research has carved out a distinctive position in the AI landscape: a company committed to <a href=\"https://nousresearch.com/\">open-source releases</a> that compete with — and sometimes exceed — proprietary alternatives.</p><p>The company raised<a href=\"https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/04/25/paradigm-nous-research-crypto-ai-venture-capital-deepseek-openai-blockchain/\"> $50 million in April 2025</a> in a round led by Paradigm, the cryptocurrency-focused venture firm founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. Total funding reached $65 million, according to some reports. The investment reflected growing interest in decentralized approaches to AI training, an area where Nous Research has developed its <a href=\"https://psyche.network/\">Psyche platform</a>.</p><p>Previous releases include <a href=\"https://hermes4.nousresearch.com/\">Hermes 4</a>, a family of models that we reported &quot;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/nous-research-drops-hermes-4-ai-models-that-outperform-chatgpt-without-content-restrictions\">outperform ChatGPT without content restrictions</a>,&quot; and DeepHermes-3, which the company described as the first &quot;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/personalized-unrestricted-ai-lab-nous-research-launches-first-toggle-on-reasoning-model-deephermes-3\">toggle-on reasoning model</a>&quot; — allowing users to activate extended thinking capabilities on demand.</p><p>The company has cultivated a distinctive aesthetic and community, prompting some skepticism about whether style might overshadow substance. &quot;Ofc i&#x27;m gonna believe an anime pfp company. stop benchmarkmaxxing ffs,&quot; <a href=\"https://x.com/shydev69/status/2008654826356535510?s=20\">wrote one critic on X</a>, referring to Nous Research&#x27;s anime-style branding and the industry practice of optimizing for benchmark performance.</p><p>Others raised technical questions. &quot;<a href=\"https://x.com/yehor_smoliakov/status/2008659681489940757?s=20\">Based on the benchmark, Nemotron is better</a>,&quot; noted one commenter, referring to Nvidia&#x27;s family of language models. Another asked whether <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/NousCoder-14B\">NousCoder-14B</a> is &quot;agentic focused or just &#x27;one shot&#x27; coding&quot; — a distinction that matters for practical software development, where iterating on feedback typically produces better results than single attempts.</p><hr /><h2><b>What researchers say must happen next for AI coding tools to keep improving</b></h2><p>The release includes several directions for future work that hint at where AI coding research may be heading.</p><p>Multi-turn reinforcement learning tops the list. Currently, the model receives only a final binary reward — pass or fail — after generating a solution. But competitive programming problems typically include public test cases that provide intermediate feedback: compilation errors, incorrect outputs, time limit violations. Training models to incorporate this feedback across multiple attempts could significantly improve performance.</p><p>Controlling response length also remains a challenge. The researchers found that incorrect solutions tended to be longer than correct ones, and response lengths quickly saturated available context windows during training — a pattern that various algorithmic modifications failed to resolve.</p><p>Perhaps most ambitiously, Li proposed &quot;problem generation and self-play&quot; — training models to both solve and create programming problems. This would address the data scarcity problem directly by enabling models to generate their own training curricula.</p><p>&quot;Humans are great at generating interesting and useful problems for other competitive programmers, but it appears that there still exists a significant gap in LLM capabilities in creative problem generation,&quot; Li wrote.</p><p>The model is <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/NousCoder-14B\">available now on Hugging Face</a> under an Apache 2.0 license. For researchers and developers who want to build on the work, Nous Research has published the complete <a href=\"https://github.com/NousResearch/atropos/pull/296\">Atropos training stack</a> alongside it.</p><p>What took Li two years of adolescent dedication to achieve—climbing from a 1600-level novice to a 2100-rated competitor on Codeforces—an AI replicated in 96 hours. He needed 1,000 problems. The model needed 24,000. But soon enough, these systems may learn to write their own problems, teach themselves, and leave human benchmarks behind entirely.</p><p>The question is no longer whether machines can learn to code. It&#x27;s whether they&#x27;ll soon be better teachers than we ever were.</p><p>\n</p>",

        "summary": "<p>When the creator of the world&#x27;s most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn&#x27;t just listen — it takes notes.</p><p>For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177\">thread on X</a> from <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny\">Boris Cherny</a>, the creator and head of <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview\">Claude Code</a> at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a>. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup.</p><div></div><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you&#x27;re behind as a programmer,&quot; wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/jefftangx\">Jeff Tang</a>, a prominent voice in the developer community. <a href=\"https://x.com/KyleMcnease/status/2007555584724480338\">Kyle McNease</a>, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny&#x27;s &quot;game-changing updates,&quot; Anthropic is &quot;on fire,&quot; potentially facing &quot;their ChatGPT moment.&quot;</p><p>The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny&#x27;s workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny&#x27;s setup, the experience &quot;<a href=\"https://x.com/mtwichan\">feels more like Starcraft</a>&quot; than traditional coding — a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.</p><p>Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. </p><h2><b>How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game</b></h2><p>The most striking revelation from Cherny&#x27;s disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional &quot;<a href=\"https://notes.paulswail.com/public/The+inner+and+outer+loops+of+software+development+workflow\">inner loop</a>&quot; of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.</p><p>&quot;I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal,&quot; Cherny wrote. &quot;I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input.&quot;</p><p>By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs &quot;5-10 Claudes on <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">claude.ai</a>&quot; in his browser, using a &quot;teleport&quot; command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.</p><p>This validates the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/03/anthropic-daniela-amodei-do-more-with-less-bet.html\">do more with less</a>&quot; strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.</p><h2><b>The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model</b></h2><p>In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic&#x27;s heaviest, slowest model: <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5\">Opus 4.5</a>.</p><p>&quot;I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything,&quot; Cherny <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179838864666847\">explained</a>. &quot;It&#x27;s the best coding model I&#x27;ve ever used, and even though it&#x27;s bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it&#x27;s better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end.&quot;</p><p>For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn&#x27;t the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI&#x27;s mistakes. Cherny&#x27;s workflow suggests that paying the &quot;compute tax&quot; for a smarter model upfront eliminates the &quot;correction tax&quot; later.</p><h2><b>One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson</b></h2><p>Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not &quot;remember&quot; a company&#x27;s specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.</p><p>To address this, Cherny&#x27;s team maintains a single file named <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179842928947333\">CLAUDE.md</a> in their git repository. &quot;Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time,&quot; he wrote.</p><p>This practice transforms the codebase into a self-correcting organism. When a human developer reviews a pull request and spots an error, they don&#x27;t just fix the code; they tag the AI to update its own instructions. &quot;<a href=\"https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2007347705945944153\">Every mistake becomes a rule</a>,&quot; noted <a href=\"https://x.com/aakashgupta\">Aakash Gupta</a>, a product leader analyzing the thread. The longer the team works together, the smarter the agent becomes.</p><h2><b>Slash commands and subagents automate the most tedious parts of development</b></h2><p>The &quot;vanilla&quot; workflow one observer praised is powered by rigorous automation of repetitive tasks. Cherny uses slash commands — custom shortcuts checked into the project&#x27;s repository — to handle complex operations with a single keystroke.</p><p>He highlighted a command called <i><b>/commit-push-pr</b></i>, which he invokes dozens of times daily. Instead of manually typing git commands, writing a commit message, and opening a pull request, the agent handles the bureaucracy of version control autonomously.</p><p>Cherny also deploys subagents — specialized AI personas — to handle specific phases of the development lifecycle. He uses a code-simplifier to clean up architecture after the main work is done and a verify-app agent to run end-to-end tests before anything ships.</p><h2><b>Why verification loops are the real unlock for AI-generated code</b></h2><p>If there is a single reason Claude Code has reportedly hit <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone\">$1 billion in annual recurring revenue</a> so quickly, it is likely the verification loop. The AI is not just a text generator; it is a tester.</p><p>&quot;Claude tests every single change I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension,&quot; Cherny wrote. &quot;It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works and the UX feels good.&quot;</p><p>He argues that giving the AI a way to verify its own work — whether through browser automation, running bash commands, or executing test suites — improves the quality of the final result by &quot;2-3x.&quot; The agent doesn&#x27;t just write code; it proves the code works.</p><h2><b>What Cherny&#x27;s workflow signals about the future of software engineering</b></h2><p>The reaction to Cherny&#x27;s thread suggests a pivotal shift in how developers think about their craft. For years, &quot;AI coding&quot; meant an autocomplete function in a text editor — a faster way to type. Cherny has demonstrated that it can now function as an operating system for labor itself.</p><p>&quot;Read this if you&#x27;re already an engineer... and want more power,&quot; <a href=\"https://x.com/jefftangx/status/2008246873275215890\">Jeff Tang</a> summarized on X.</p><p>The tools to multiply human output by a factor of five are already here. They require only a willingness to stop thinking of AI as an assistant and start treating it as a workforce. The programmers who make that mental leap first won&#x27;t just be more productive. They&#x27;ll be playing an entirely different game — and everyone else will still be typing.</p>",

        "summary": "arXiv:2510.04141v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: This survey paper chronicles the evolution of evaluation in multimodal artificial intelligence (AI), framing it as a progression of increasingly sophisticated \"cognitive examinations.\" We argue that the field is undergoing a paradigm shift, moving from simple recognition tasks that test \"what\" a model sees, to complex reasoning benchmarks that probe \"why\" and \"how\" it understands. This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks, where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey from the foundational \"knowledge tests\" of the ImageNet era to the \"applied logic and comprehension\" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey the current frontier of \"expert-level integration\" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench, SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself. Finally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative, and social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating truly intelligent systems.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2511.06101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Web agents struggle to adapt to new websites due to the scarcity of environment specific tasks and demonstrations. Recent works have explored synthetic data generation to address this challenge, however, they suffer from data quality issues where synthesized tasks contain hallucinations that cannot be executed, and collected trajectories are noisy with redundant or misaligned actions. In this paper, we propose SynthAgent, a fully synthetic supervision framework that aims at improving synthetic data quality via dual refinement of both tasks and trajectories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse tasks through categorized exploration of web elements, ensuring efficient coverage of the target environment. During trajectory collection, tasks are refined only when conflicts with observations are detected, which mitigates hallucinations while preserving task consistency. After collection, we conduct trajectory refinement with global context to mitigate potential noise or misalignments. Finally, we fine-tune open-source web agents on the refined synthetic data to adapt them to the target environment. Experimental results demonstrate that SynthAgent outperforms existing synthetic data methods, validating the importance of high-quality synthetic supervision.

        "summary": "arXiv:2601.02837v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small target size, and complex cluttered backgrounds. Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.19155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: To develop a machine learning-based framework for accurately modeling the anode heel effect in Monte Carlo simulations of X-ray imaging systems, enabling realistic beam intensity profiles with minimal experimental calibration. Multiple regression models were trained to predict spatial intensity variations along the anode-cathode axis using experimentally acquired weights derived from beam measurements across different tube potentials. These weights captured the asymmetry introduced by the anode heel effect. A systematic fine-tuning protocol was established to minimize the number of required measurements while preserving model accuracy. The models were implemented in the OpenGATE 10 and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits to evaluate their integration feasibility and predictive performance. Among the tested models, gradient boosting regression (GBR) delivered the highest accuracy, with prediction errors remaining below 5% across all energy levels. The optimized fine-tuning strategy required only six detector positions per energy level, reducing measurement effort by 65%. The maximum error introduced through this fine-tuning process remained below 2%. Dose actor comparisons within Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the GBR-based model closely replicated clinical beam profiles and significantly outperformed conventional symmetric beam models. This study presents a robust and generalizable method for incorporating the anode heel effect into Monte Carlo simulations using machine learning. By enabling accurate, energy-dependent beam modeling with limited calibration data, the approach enhances simulation realism for applications in clinical dosimetry, image quality assessment, and radiation protection.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2601.02818v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Spatial prediction of reservoir parameters, especially permeability, is crucial for oil and gas exploration and development. However, the wide range and high variability of permeability prevent existing methods from providing reliable predictions. For the first time in subsurface spatial prediction, this study presents a quantum-enhanced long short-term memory with attention (QLSTMA) model that incorporates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the recurrent cell. Using quantum entanglement and superposition principles, the QLSTMA significantly improves the ability to predict complex geological parameters such as permeability. Two quantization structures, QLSTMA with Shared Gates (QLSTMA-SG) and with Independent Gates (QLSTMA-IG), are designed to investigate and evaluate the effects of quantum structure configurations and the number of qubits on model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the 8-qubit QLSTMA-IG model significantly outperforms the traditional long short-term memory with attention (LSTMA), reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 19% and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 20%, with particularly strong performance in regions featuring complex well-logging data. These findings validate the potential of quantum-classical hybrid neural networks for reservoir prediction, indicating that increasing the number of qubits yields further accuracy gains despite the reliance on classical simulations. This study establishes a foundational framework for the eventual deployment of such models on real quantum hardware and their extension to broader applications in petroleum engineering and geoscience.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2601.02382v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We present a retrieval-augmented question answering framework for 5G/6G networks, where the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become central to disaggregated, virtualized, and AI-driven wireless systems. While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&amp;A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&amp;A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability.",

I have IELTS of 7,5 and I have yet to still take entry exams.</p> <p>Tl;dr: should K study software engineering 4 years in china or medecine 6 years in italy (if I ever get accepted)</p> <p>I thought about it alot and my choices boiled down to software engineering or medecine.</p> <p>Part 1: Software engineering: </p> <p>Positives: I'd get to study in china in an English taught programs. 4 years of education with hopefully a fully funded scholarship. I liked programming ever since I was a kid and I'm strong in maths and physics (relatively, ik that this is harder than highschool education). I also like the flexibility and modularity of it. Im not stuck in china once I finish my education there and it’s one of their best universities (shanghai jiao tong uni). Also its Shanghai one of the biggest cities in the world and it seems very cool.</p> <p>Negative points: I dont like where the landscape of software engineering or IT in general is going. Its all start ups that try to solve problems that basically dont exist and its always about management following the latest trends. I also feel like my work won't have much impact and I dont like the monetisation practices there. I also dont like the idea that the best tech companies are ones that fuel the Palestinian genocide in the middle East and I don't want to contribute although ig my work won't contribute directly. But these companies must be boycotted.</p> <p>Part 2: medecine:</p> <p>Positives: big fan of biology and human anatomy although I didn't do particularly well in high school. The salary is great and you study 6 year before you spécialise. I've always wanted to be a surgeon as a kid (yaayy so original) and the science really seemed intresting, especially when I got to study a bit in my country's medical school a bit before I left to think about what I wanted to do end of last year. It just seems so fascinating and my parents both are doctors (3rd world so we're not rich though we are financially stable+ we're 4 brothers in the house so I don't want them to fund my education and leave theirs, especially after the tariffs). I'll study in italy though I dont know which university. At least hopefully if I get accepted.</p> <p>Negatives: I dont like to memorise and everyone told me it's hell in their. 6 years + how many other years I have to study to spécialise is alot. Also not guaranteed that I get accepted and their is no scholarship weirdly enough so I have to constantly manage a job+ education to somehow. Also Italy is one of the poorest european countries and I dont want to be stuck there after ly education. But it seems that a doctors job is way less flexible and you have to pass exams to work in other countries which are hard. Also language barrier might cause problems work with real life consequences. Also everyone seemed from high income families and a bit smug when I studied with them. It was boring and I dont want to grow up being around naive man children. Everything's an aesthetic nothing has substance lol. + I'm not that good when it comes to communicating with people and doctors need it to perform well so idk if im up for it. Also I hate how everything's memorisation when it comes to studying medecine and idk if im up for it.</p> <p>Sorry for any mistakes in the writing its 5 am and I didnt sleep so its kind of hard to keep my thoughts straight. Thank you very much for taking the time to either look, read or answer my questions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Witty_Newspaper_3160\"> /u/Witty_Newspaper_3160 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1q4bets/what_should_i_study_software_engineering_chinz/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1q4bets/what_should_i_study_software_engineering_chinz/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "summary": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Okay, so my dissertation is all about microbial colony measurements (colony radii), and what we can learn about the underlying biology from those measurements. Along with that, I built some software to collect these measurements, and I have many experiments that use them. </p> <p>These measurements are not particularly widely used in microbial colony analysis, at least at the scale I am using them, which means that along with collecting the measurements, it falls to me to develop some kind of &quot;interpretive/analytical framework&quot; for what to do with them. </p> <p>The dissertation has 4 parts (with 5 chapters each). </p> <p><strong>Part 1</strong> introduces the software and the analytical framework I developed. </p> <p><strong>Part 2</strong> Validates it (using existing published figures, re-analyzing the photos with my software, and adding quantitative rigor to mainly qualitative analysis in those studies) </p> <p><strong>Part 3</strong> is my own wet lab experiments. I photograph my own petri dishes, again use the software to analyze them, and the analytical framework to explain &quot;what they mean&quot; </p> <p><strong>Part 4</strong> does not use my software at all, it corroborates the part 3 findings using more traditional methods. </p> <p>I am asking about part 1, where I develop the analytical framework. </p> <p>In that section, I describe using Kernel Density Estimation and Mixture modeling for biological insights of colony growth dynamics. These are well established statistical methods, but as far as I can tell haven't been used for this specific use case. I need to make the connection between those statistical methods and the specific biological interpretations. I also need to make a case for WHY to use these methods. </p> <p>So, my current draft includes a &quot;Thought Experiment&quot; of three colony sets, meant to establish why we need the analytical framework. </p> <p>(Colony set: the list of colony radius measurements corresponding to one experimental condition. For example... imagine a temp assay, you're growing 5 different petri dishes at different temps. A colony set is all of the colonies on one of those plates)</p> <p>These three (hypothetical) colony sets have the same Mean and Variance. But, if you create a histogram, where the X axis is colony radius and the Y axis is frequency of detecting that colony size... you see the three colony sets show very different histograms. </p> <p>Colony set A creates a unimodal, normally distributed curve, Colony Set B is heavily skewed, and Colony set C is multimodal. Those all tell different stories about the underlying biology, but summary statistics don't differentiate between them. That's why we need KDE and Mixture Modeling. </p> <p>So, I discuss the two methods, then I get back to using them to pull biological insight out of the histograms. For example, Colony set A shows colonies with a very uniform rate of success of cell division, Colony set C shows two populations, one that is dividing very successfully, the other is hitting some cell division failure. Colony Set B is interpreted as a middle ground between the two extremes... indicating some restructuring of the colony set in progress.</p> <p>Because these are hypothetical constructs, we can really only go as far as using them to prove what kind of heterogeneity we &quot;might&quot; find in this sort of data, and what we &quot;might&quot; conclude if we did see this data. Later on in part 2, I have data that looks exactly like the thought experiment. Across three petri dishes, you see a colony set that looks like A, then the next dish looks like B, then the third looks like C. </p> <p>In part 2, I point back to part 1 &quot;remember when we talked about that hypothetical case? Here we have something very similar, so we apply the same deductive reasoning and reach this interpretation, which is very consistent with the known biology for this strain&quot;. </p> <p>So, the thought experiment then gets backed up with real data in part 2.</p> <p>I thought about using the real data in part 1... but at that point, I haven't introduced the experiment, so it would be too early to bring up. Readers would say &quot;what is this data? I haven't seen where it came from&quot;. I could also have no thought experiment and no data in part 1, but then the explanation ends up really vague. I'd end up just talking about statistical methods and promise payoff that doesn't come until part 2, over 100 pages later.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Worried_Clothes_8713\"> /u/Worried_Clothes_8713 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1q5z17z/are_thought_experiments_ever_appropriate_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1q5z17z/are_thought_experiments_ever_appropriate_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "summary": "<p>by Ben Vezina, Helena B. Cooper, Christopher K. Barlow, Martin Rethoret-Pasty, Sylvain Brisse, Jonathan M. Monk, Kathryn E. Holt, Kelly L. Wyres</p>\n\nThe <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> species complex inhabits a wide variety of hosts and environments, and is a major cause of antimicrobial resistant infections. Genomics has revealed the population comprises multiple species/sub-species and hundreds of distinct co-circulating sub-lineage (SLs) that are associated with distinct gene complements. A substantial fraction of the pan-genome is predicted to be involved in metabolic functions and hence these data are consistent with metabolic differentiation at the SL level. However, this has so far remained unsubstantiated because in the past it was not possible to explore metabolic variation at scale. Here, we used a combination of comparative genomics and high-throughput genome-scale metabolic modeling to systematically explore metabolic diversity across the <i>K. pneumoniae</i> species complex (<i>n</i> = 7,835 genomes). We simulated growth outcomes for each isolate using carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur sources under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (<i>n</i> = 1,278 conditions per isolate). We showed that the distributions of metabolic genes and growth capabilities are structured in the population, and confirmed that SLs exhibit unique metabolic profiles. In vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated reciprocal commensalistic cross-feeding between SLs, effectively extending the range of conditions supporting individual growth. We propose that these substrate specializations may promote the existence and persistence of co-circulating SLs by reducing nutrient competition and facilitating commensal interactions. Our findings have implications for understanding the eco-evolutionary dynamics of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and for the design of novel strategies to prevent opportunistic infections caused by this World Health Organization priority antimicrobial resistant pathogen.",

        "summary": "<p>Arizona is wild in its environmental diversity, boasting five of the six distinct types of ecological biomes. Tundra, forest, woodland, scrub, grassland, and desert biomes are spread across the state, with four deserts, over 210 named mountain ranges, a biblical-scale monsoon season—and, of course, the Grand Canyon. The Sonoran Desert, which stretches across much of the state’s southern half, is a “lush desert,” meaning that it receives rain twice a year, and thus features a visually stunning blend of sepia tones and deep green vegetation.</p>\n<p>The state’s rich culture reflects the diversity of its Native populations and the many who have migrated to the area, along with a strong connection to Mexican cultural heritage. The region is the ancestral and current home to twenty-two federally recognized Native American tribes, including Diné (Navajo Nation) and the Tohono O'odham Nation.</p>\n<h3>Northern Region: Flagstaff and Holbrook</h3>\n<div class=\"flip-card\">\n<div class=\"flip-card-inner\">\n<div class=\"flip-card-front\"><img alt=\"Rainbow Forest\" src=\"https://atlas-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/assets/3d9f05e0-b5c9-4e76-b602-b0ba966c55661bc89aed0ef0a7e6e3_Wood%20and%20rock%20converge%20in%20the%20Rainbow%20Forest,%20where%20nothing%20is%20exactly%20as%20it%20seems.jpg\" /></div>\n<div class=\"flip-card-back\">\n<h3>Behold Arizona’s Sublime Beauty</h3>\n<p>The Rainbow Forest includes the largest and most colorful displays of petrified wood in Petrified Forest National Park.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flip-card-instructions\">Tap/hover to learn more!</div>\n</div>\n<p>Ancient geology and celestial discovery converge in Northern Arizona, inviting travelers to reflect on humanity’s place between the stars above and the eons below. Many visitors come for the Grand Canyon, but Northern Arizona contains multitudes. The high-elevation region features rugged mountain ranges, the state’s highest peak, and four distinct seasons, making it a destination for winter sports, mountaineering, and astronomy. The charming city of Flagstaff serves as home base to Northern Arizona University, the regional destination ski resort Snowbowl, and the Flagstaff Mountain Film Festival.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106241/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lowell-observatory\">Lowell Observatory</a></h3>\n<p>Stargazers flock to Lowell Observatory, a world-class astronomy destination on the edge of Flagstaff. The site has been in continuous operation since the late 1800s, when it was established by Percival Lowell, a financier and astronomer who became obsessed with the possibility of life on Mars. Lowell had the means to fund his fascinations, and thus Lowell Observatory was built, with Northern Arizona selected as its site for its high elevation and dark skies. Pluto was discovered here, and the city’s commitment was recognized in 2001, when Flagstaff became the first International Dark Sky City.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106242/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><a href=\"http://www2.lowell.edu/users/elgb/observing_site.html\">Mars Hill and Anderson Mesa</a></h3>\n<p>Just west of Flagstaff proper sits Mars Hill, part of Lowell Observatory’s campus and the site of the apocryphal origin story of the theory of dark matter. As you drive up the hill, spot the iconic dome of the Clark Refractor, a telescope dating back to the 1800s.

Is it wood? The answer is yes at Petrified Forest National Park, where hundreds of millions of years of the organic process of permineralization have turned what was once a forest of trees into a wavy psychedelic desert landscape laden with fossils. These artifacts of the Triassic period (the era when dinosaurs are thought to have first appeared) include compression fossils of leaves, seeds, insects, and fish as well as scattered petrified logs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/106244/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/850116.htm#6/27.450/-89.143\">Rainbow Forest</a></h3>\n<p>Nestled within Petrified Forest National Park, the Rainbow Forest features huge, vibrant rocks in deep reds, yellows, blues, and purples.

And all of these characters wearing huge papier-mâché masks come parading out.

It’s close to the very center of West Virginia, high in the Allegheny Mountains, one of the more rugged parts of the Appalachian Mountain chain. Helvetia is not easy to get to.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara: </strong>You end up driving at least an hour to get to Helvetia on very windy roads. It is the middle of winter, often very cold. Sometimes we have a couple feet of snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>This is Clara Lehmann. She’s a filmmaker who lives in Helvetia and grew up there. And today she’s the director of the Fasnacht Festival.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara:</strong> People feel like they are paused for a moment when they go to Helvetia. There’s no cell phone service. It’s quiet. There are no highways. You’re definitely driving on winding roads. And the community, while we’re small, is very welcoming and warm and wants to have you here.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Small, meaning a population of around 60. But at the end of every winter, when the annual celebration of Fasnacht comes around, the town grows to 20 times its size.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara:</strong> This is not a modern tradition. It’s very, very old.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> The story of Fasnacht in Helvetia goes back to the founding of the town in 1869. That’s when five Swiss families moved to Helvetia from Brooklyn. The mountains, they said, reminded them of home.</p>\n<p>One of the earliest recorded celebrations of Fasnacht was in the 14th century in Basel, Switzerland. It probably goes even further back than that, to a pre-Christian ritual that marks the coming of spring.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara: </strong>Fasnacht, interestingly, is German for “fasting night.” “Fas” meaning fasting, “nacht” meaning night. But more recognizably, Fasnacht is Mardi Gras. It’s supposed to fall on Fat Tuesday because you would eat all your fatty foods on Tuesday, and then on Wednesday you begin Lent.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> The big party of Fat Tuesday or Fasnacht is supposed to get you through the next 40 days of fasting. This fasting, of course, comes from religious traditions, but Clara says it’s practical, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara: </strong>In the time that my ancestors came from Switzerland, a lot of them were farmers, and so they’re that — you are reliant on the land. They have harsh winters, and you oftentimes had to put a lot of resources away in order to make it through winter. And this was the one day in that winter time that you were allowed to really let go, be like, I’m gonna have a drink. Oh wait, I’m gonna eat that extra potato. I don’t know.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Indulging in that one potato led to other forms of indulgence. Over the years, Fasnacht and other Mardi Gras traditions became associated with masquerades, parades, music, and mischief.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara:</strong> That’s a very important element to Fasnacht. It allows a community to get together, be a little bit curious and odd, and play different roles or poke fun at neighbors or politics in a way that is safe.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>But while Fasnacht celebrations in Switzerland are these big carnivals, Clara says the early Fasnacht in Helvetia were very different.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara: </strong>Originally, a lot of our community members celebrated this privately in their homes. You bring the homemade wine, I’ll bring a homemade dish, we’ll make some rosettes, which are a fatty, fried, like a donut or like a funnel cake, but it’s in the shape of a beautiful flower. And then we’ll share and we share food together and we play music and we sing.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> So that was how it was originally done in Helvetia. But then things changed after World War I and World War II.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara:</strong> In the 1940s and ’50s, there were anti-German sentiments that were still hanging over Helvetia, and that was due to the world wars. And so there was a lot of antagonism that was happening, and so the community started to shun its Swiss identity in order to protect itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>During this period, Fasnacht was almost lost. But then two local women got involved. Their names were Eleanor Mailloux and Dolores Baggerly, and they ran a restaurant together. Eleanor was Clara’s grandmother. Clara sometimes calls her Mueter, the Swiss German word for mother. And Clara remembers trying to get a look at her grandmother’s Fasnacht mask in the back of the restaurant.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara:</strong> And I would sneak back into the winter part where she would have her mask drying by the wood stove and see what she — I thought she was building. You know, it’d be very rudimentary early on, so you wouldn’t know.</p>\n<p>It’d be like, oh, I wonder if it’s gonna be gruesome or pretty, and she usually leaned gruesome. So in the 1960s, ’70s, the community was having struggles economically, with retention, with upkeep, you know.</p>\n<p>Mueter and Dolores were like, man, we really need to figure out ways to remind people that this identity is special. And also, how can we make sure that the little restaurant and the little post office in the library can survive?</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>So Dolores and Mueter Eleanor started decorating their restaurant with Swiss folk art and making traditional foods. And they decided to make Fasnacht a public celebration.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara: </strong>And so that first few years, it was Dolores and my grandmother dressing up in masks only. There were maybe two or three masks. Eleanor Mailloux wore a mask with big antlers. She made it out of papier-mâché, and then a lot of folks hunt in our area, so she had some antlers laying around and attached them and became some kind of beast of the woods. There are stories of children remembering that year because they were scared of both of these women.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> It wasn’t until the 1990s, though, that the festival really took off. That’s when a local psychology professor at West Virginia University named Rogers McAvoy encouraged his students to go to Fasnacht and to mask up.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara: </strong>And sometimes they were the more masked participants than even our local individuals.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Today, masking is a huge part of the Fasnacht Festival in Helvetia. Usually, people make the masks out of papier-mâché and work on them for weeks or months.</p>\n<p>Some are more gruesome, like Eleanor’s, to scare away Old Man Winter. Others are more about welcoming spring with flowers and suns. And some are just weird.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara:</strong> People really put themselves into these masks. They’re pieces of art. I’ve seen a group of possums, that was adorable. I remember one year there was a mask that had a battery pack in it with a mouse running in a wheel placed inside, as if it was a part of the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Sometimes the masks are a commentary on things that have happened in town during the year.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara: </strong>One year we had a couple who dressed up as a cow and a milkmaid, and that was to poke fun at the fact that someone in our community had tried to have dairy and it didn’t work out. And so there were things that you can laugh about and release. It’s letting you release something that maybe you have been holding on to, and it’s like, hey, let it go and let’s move on.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Letting go and moving on is a big part of Fasnacht. First, you eat the rosettes and the other fried food, then you jam and dance in the dance hall, then you parade out into that field in your costumes. And then it’s time to say goodbye to Old Man Winter.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara:</strong> We untether Old Man Winter, who we have propped up inside our gazebo. It is papier-mâché or a mixed media. It’s a human form of an Old Man Winter, and we take him across the little footbridge and down the road to a large bonfire, toss him on the bonfire, and then we have a nice big square dance in the community hall after that.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>These days, about a thousand people come to Fasnacht every year, and that’s a big deal. When you remember, the town usually has only 60 people living in it.</p>\n<p>One reason the festival has grown over the last few years is actually a video game. It’s called <em>Fallout 76</em>, and it’s a post-apocalyptic survival role-playing game. One popular update lets you wander around a virtual Helvetia and participate in a virtual Fasnacht.</p>\n<p>Clara says people in town love it because the more people hear about Fasnacht and come to Fasnacht, the more strange it gets.</p>\n<p><strong>Clara: </strong>This is a little weird, and I will admit it’s weird. Seeing a thousand masks or, you know, people dressed oddly is strange in the middle of Appalachia, but it’s really special. And I think that sometimes people come away from it with a spiritual experience, and that can be religious, it can be catharsis, it can be slightly just healing.</p>\n<p>And I think that’s a point is to bring community together and celebrate who we are, wherever we are, and however we are, and then allow ourselves to make it through the last little bit of winter before spring comes and heals us even more and lets us get back together uh in warmth.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> The date of Fasnacht changes every year with the Easter calendar, just like Mardi Gras.

These beer-like beverages go by names like </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cauim</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">caxiri</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tarubá</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fermentation is an important step in cassava processing—the raw root has chemicals that can turn into cyanide in the human body. Native peoples found that a bit of human saliva and some naturally occurring yeast could eliminate these toxins and improve the nutritious value of the tuber. When the technology of distillation arrived to the Munim River region (now in Maranhão), locals who already drank lightly alcoholic cassava beverages began to distill them. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiquira</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was born. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name <em>tiquira</em> is likely derived from the Tupi word </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tykyre </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">meaning \"to drip.\" But it is a curiosity that the spirit has flourished in only one Brazilian state, Maranhão. Margot Stinglwagner, founder of </span><a href=\"https://www.guaajatiquira.com/en/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guaaja Tiquira</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the first modern brand to produce the spirit starting in 2016, says “It’s a spirit that is also unknown in Brazil. A few people have heard about tiquira—but usually only people who have gone to Maranhão once.” Accordingly, the state moved to declare the spirit as a piece of Cultural and Intangible Heritage </span><a href=\"https://www.al.ma.leg.br/noticias/48515\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in September 2023</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the reason that tiquira has remained so isolated is that cachaça, Brazil’s rum, is far easier to produce. Because the rum comes from sugarcane, the sugar for fermentation is already there. “With cassava, you don’t have sugar,” Stinglwagner explains. “You must first transform the carbohydrates into sugar and then you can ferment and distill it.” To achieve this end, Guaaja Tiquira uses food enzymes instead of the traditional human saliva. Guaaja also differs from other distillers because they use full cassava roots where most tiquira moonshiners rely on processed </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">farinha de mandioca</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or cassava flour. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The majority of people produce it illegally,” laughs Stinglwagner. “The state does nothing about it.” Outside of the urban center, tiquira is invariably a homemade product. Generally, tiquira makers don’t separate the \"heads\" (the first drops of liquor from a distillation, which contain harsher alcohols including toxic methanol and other pungent and volatile flavor compounds) from the \"tails\" (the final liquid produced from distillation, which has a low alcohol content and can have unwelcome bitter flavors), meaning the spirit is stronger and may contain more toxins and impurities. Some even macerate marijuana into the combined spirit to produce the doubly-illicit <em>tiquiconha</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maranhenses believe that you cannot get wet or bathe after drinking tiquira, lest you become faint or dizzy. Zelinda Machado de Castro e Lima, one of the great chroniclers of folk culture in Maranhão, has recorded other traditions surrounding the drink. Firstly, it is typical to pierce a cashew with a toothpick and soak it in a glass of tiquira for several hours. It is then sucked as a sort of boozy lollipop. She also writes about the belief that those drinking coffee should avoid tiquira, while locals say that fishermen on the coast used the liquor to sanitize wounds incurred on the job. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, there is the curious question of the color of tiquira. In the tourist markets of São Luís, the spirit is always blushing a translucent violet. “They say that the color of tiquira is from tangerine leaves, but we tried to do it and the color from the leaves is not stable,” says Stinglwagner. “It is also not a strong color. The norms and laws for tiquira prohibit the addition of the leaves.” The violet color may be artificial (perhaps from food dyes), but some tiquiras do have a citrusy flavor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tiquira today is still largely relegated to the world of moonshining, but with the government’s recognition of the spirit and new legitimate ventures like that of Guaaja Tiquira, Brazil could be seeing more of the cassava liquor outside of its home in Maranhão. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“All the people say to me, ‘What is this new spirit?,’” says Stinglwagner. “I say, ‘It’s not a new spirit, it’s the oldest spirit from Brazil.’”</span></p>\n<p><strong>Know Before You Go</strong></p>\n<p>Tiquira is widely available in the downtown markets of São Luís, Maranhão. Both the local Mercado Central and touristic Mercado das Tulhas have many vendors selling tiquira. The commercial brand, Guaaja Tiquira, is also available in São Luís at Empório Fribal, in addition to Copacabana Palace and Fairmont Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, and Mocotó Bar e Restaurante in São Paulo. </p>",

Like the educational kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason Williams:</strong> I was obsessed with the show <em>Great Chefs Great Cities</em>, which was a program back on in the early, late ’80s, probably, where they’d go to different restaurant kitchens and make a dish.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Jason grew up on the East Coast in a small town. It was nice, but it was not the ideal place to learn to become a chef.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> I grew up in New Hampshire and didn’t have a lot of access to crazy ingredients.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> The closest bigger town was across the border in Maine. But when he went there as a kid, he wasn’t going for the food.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> So I’d come to Portland growing up as a kid. We used to come over here and skateboard and, you know, all that fun stuff and just kind of be in the city.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Back then, the big city of Portland, Maine wasn’t necessarily known for its food scene.

After he fell in love with <em>Great Chefs Great Cities</em>, he went to culinary school. He left New England to work in restaurants around the country, classy kitchens, high-end resorts, a renowned seafood restaurant on Maui, a winery in Napa Valley. But eventually he started to miss the Northeast.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Thought about raising a family, and New England’s kind of the perfect place to raise kids, so we came here for vacation and just kind of fell back in love with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> It was about two decades ago, and Portland, Maine had changed after Jason left. He got a job working at a local restaurant, and one day he was driving around to farmers markets looking for ingredients when he found a special place.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> I just happened to drive up this road, and I had just a really cool feeling when I rounded the corner, and I’m like, wait a second, this is a farm? Wait a second, I could get all my shopping done right here? So I just pulled in. It is a 120-acre farm, about three miles from the ocean. A produce farm, it’s fourth generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>It’s called Jordan’s Farm, run by the Jordan family. It’s a few miles south of Portland in the town of Cape Elizabeth, which conveniently is also where Jason was living. So he started getting produce from Jordan’s Farm and bringing it back to the restaurant where he was working.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> They allowed me to kind of come out back and hand select produce and stuff like that, which is huge in my world.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Eventually, after a few years of shopping at the farm …</p>\n<p><strong>Jason: </strong>I just pitched them the idea. I drew up a picture of a flatbed trailer and was like, what if we just did a food trailer here and I can work in your off hours? If it doesn’t work, we’ll wheel away and uh throw some grass seed down and it’ll be like it never happened.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>What Jason was proposing was to literally build a kitchen on the back of a flatbed trailer. That way, if the project was not a success, he would just tow it away and the Jordans could get back to business as usual. Jason was nervous. He’d never run a restaurant before, but the farm …</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> They went for it. They were like, great idea, and they were so supportive and just really let me make this happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Jason got the blessing of the chef where he was working and went out on his own, building out that kitchen trailer at Jordan’s farm.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Busted out the graph paper. I was like, okay, well, you know, small dimensions, what can we actually do for equipment? Just a leap of faith, obviously. I tried to do it on a tight budget. I didn’t come out swinging with a huge space, a state-of-the-art kitchen. I just kind of built what was necessary for me to make nice food.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> He didn’t know how to run a restaurant. He did know how to make nice food. Every day, he would go into Jordan’s farm, see what looked best, and design a couple of dishes around what they had. He called his project The Well, as in eating well, also as in a watering hole, a place where people gather. And since he got to invent the menu every morning, he could get really specific.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason: </strong>So you can really play on the weather, what’s fresh, just the mood. Everything changes. You know, Maine can be 80 degrees one day and 50 degrees the next day and rainy. If it’s cold, I might throw a soup on. I can just adapt to what’s around me.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>He started slow and simple.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason: </strong>We didn’t have a dishwasher. I started off with just kind of compostable plates. I was just doing like a chalkboard menu with a couple items, and I had a suggested donation box here where people would just kind of come in, drop cash, and I really like people were kind of shocked by it, you know, it wasn’t something that you saw a lot, you know, 15 years ago, really, especially in this town.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Jason knew that was a gamble. The restaurant business is hard, and this was a restaurant on a farm stand. People were coming there to get produce to take home and cook for themselves. They weren’t necessarily looking to spend money on prepared food. Turns out, Jason was wrong.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason: </strong>So people would start lining up an hour before I even opened, and then all of a sudden I would be out of food in like two hours, just ripping through 70 people. We’d put a little chalkboard menu up at the top of the thing that said “The Well is dry,” and “try again the next day.”</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> At that point, Jason knew he had to expand. He built out a bigger kitchen in a real building, no wheels underneath. He hired staff, started adding menu items, not just a few things written in chalk. He added more formal seating. Before it had been picnic tables, now there would be gazebos for private dining. He started sourcing stuff from other local producers, butchers, and growers. But the concept was the same: Whatever looked best that morning, that’s what he would use.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> And then I started introducing, probably like year seven or something, I started introducing a tasting menu, an option, just like, okay, if you want to, if you trust me, we can do a five-course tasting menu and see what happens.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>What happened was people did trust him. The tasting menu became a huge part of his business. And now that’s what The Well does. Every day he’s open, it’s five fresh courses chosen that morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> A veggie course, a fish course, a grain pasta course, and then kind of your fourth course protein and a dessert. It’s really nice because I can just grab totes and walk up to the farm stand, which is like 50 yards away, and hand select whatever I need for the night.</p>\n<p>I can just adapt to what’s around me, the weather, and just new stuff that looks incredible up there. The seasons are so dramatic here in Maine. You know, things happen so quick. It’s really nice to be able to just capture that and be able to use those things that they’re hiding and put them right into play.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> A wood-grilled lamb loin with local corn and housemade barbecue sauce. A homemade brioche donut and vanilla ice cream with peaches picked that morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason: </strong>I’m not throwing a bunch of weird ingredients at you, but everything’s got to be seasoned well, cooked, executed well. So I’m really focused on those details, those small things. The fundamentals: seasoning, balance, flow of a whole tasting menu.</p>\n<p>People get so pigeonholed into what they’re comfortable ordering or eating, and maybe they’ll find out that they actually do like carrots or zucchini now, and it’s not how they remembered it from their grandmother’s mushy peas or whatever.</p>\n<p>I get inspired by like I see these farmers working crazy, so it’s nice. I really want to do my best to kind of make them proud. I want them to know that their product is first and foremost, and that I’m doing it justice.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> The Well at Jordan’s Farm has become one of the Portland area’s most popular restaurants. These days, there are a lot of great restaurants in Maine. In recent years, the state’s food scene has grown. And just like at the well, it brings together so much of what makes Maine Maine. The independence, the seasonality, the creativity. And now The Well has been part of that community for 15 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Jason:</strong> It’s really refreshing here that things are still chef-owned, smaller scale, a lot of integrity. I feel super proud of it now, 15 years later, you know, it’s been a labor of love. I worked so—I’ve never worked so hard at anything in my life, really. But it’s been—it feels good now, you know. People are celebrating years and years and years of anniversaries, of birthdays. Yeah, it feels great. I mean, what more can you ask for? In the hospitality business, you know, to feel that love back. It’s really nice.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Who knows? If there’s a reboot of <em>Great Chefs Great Cities</em>, Jason and the other restaurants that have sprung up in and around Portland, Maine might make the cut this time.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Listen and subscribe on</em></strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-atlas-obscura-podcast/id1555769970\"> <strong><em>Apple Podcasts</em></strong></a><strong><em>,</em></strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0s0c4Z99PwbW8efTmHckyT\"> <strong><em>Spotify</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and all major podcast apps.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>This episode was produced by Katie Thornton.

So when I was younger, I wasn’t interested in pottery. It was too close to home.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Karatsu is in southern Japan. It’s been a hub of pottery making for hundreds of years. Hanako comes from a family of renowned potters. So, at first, she wanted to try something different. But, after she moved to the United States at 16, slowly that started to change.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As I spent many years away from home, I started to appreciate my own cultural heritage.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It started with food, sort of.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love food, and I realized the Japanese dining experience is very unique. Not just the ingredients, but the table setting is very unique—the presentation of the food—and pottery plays a big role in that.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, Hanako knew what she had to do next.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I wanted to create a tool to enjoy food, and that was the start. European style, everything is unified, and it’s very clean. But if you go to a Japanese restaurant, repetition is often avoided. So, you would have different kinds of pottery on the table. It’s not just white things and the round things. You might start seeing something white or clean, but then next might be something in wood or bamboo or metal or glass. Texture is different, material might be different.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Hanako, there was something beautiful about all these different variations. Something that to her had a deeper meaning.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We mix all different kinds of materials and shapes and heights, and it’s creating something balanced or unified out of chaotic situations.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2010, Hanako has been living and practicing in both Japan and in rural Midcoast Maine. She says Maine’s environment is like the Japanese diningware she came to love. Varied, messy even, but also cohesive and balanced. Craggy, rocky hills next to placid blue lakes, dense forests near the wide open ocean. It’s all there, she says, and it all inspires Hanako and other artists like her.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Maine has the beauty and inspires people, artistic people, to create something beautiful. To be independent and to create your own beautiful life because of the beautiful nature. That’s what I appreciate, Maine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m Kelly McEvers, and this is </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atlas Obscura</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. This episode was produced in partnership with the Maine Office of Tourism. It’s Maine week on the show, so every day we are introducing you to someone from that great state.

It’s a philosophy that perfectly unites the two places she spends her time: Karatsu, Japan, and the 2000-person town of Union, Maine. Two places that inspire artists with their sense of community and the beauty of nature.</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an edited transcript of the </span></em><a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/podcast\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atlas Obscura Podcast</span></em></a><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places.

You see a lot of greens, sometimes I see turkeys in traffic. Yeah, we’re living in the countryside of mid-coast Maine. I love it.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you know much about Maine, you know it can be quiet and peaceful, but you also probably know that it gets pretty rugged. Being in rural Maine is a physical experience, and that resonates with Hanako. Because, so is throwing pottery on a wheel.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I used to be a serious athlete, and I like to understand the world in a physical way. And pottery is very—it requires a certain level of aestheticism.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see that in the way Hanako makes work. She starts by taking a big piece of clay and tossing it onto a table over and over, kneading it to soften it up. Then …</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You put the chunk of clay on the wheelhead.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then she pounds the sides of that chunk, centering it and guiding it upward as she does. On the top portion of the spinning mound of clay, she begins to shape a bowl or a cup. Then she uses a traditional tool that’s used in Karatsu.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A special rib, special tool, throwing tool, called gyubera.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gyubera kind of looks like a cow’s tongue. She uses it to press the walls of the cup or bowl against her outside hand and shape the pottery. Then she slices the bowl off the top of the spinning mound and begins forging another one from the clay that remains. And another and another. In her home studio with white walls and floor-to-ceiling windows that look out over the main wilderness, Hanako does this work almost like meditation as the light shifts outside.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’m a production potter, so I can make a couple hundred pieces a day. If I decide to make a cup, I make 50, or hundreds of them. Just to get in a flow. I love working in a flow, because I let go of myself and just work on the wheel, spinning, and it’s all physical. You’re not even thinking. I usually listen to house music and it’s all about the rhythm and then just doing the repetition.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hanako says the key is letting her mind get out of the way.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when the true beauty comes out. Pottery as a clay, as a material, it’s very responsive to the touch or the movement, and you have to work with intuition, you have to use senses. You can’t really think too hard.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hanako wants her art to be used: bowls, plates, cups, and carafts, but there’s always something unique about each one. An unexpected angle, a sloping edge. And since moving to Maine, the local landscape has found its way into her work too.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I often find my shape is influenced by what I see in nature. I love being in Maine because it has the ocean, the blueberry field, and the woods, and light. Light is magical here. I used to make black or white or something monotone pottery because I was more into creating shapes. But since I moved to Maine, I started making something more colorful or blue. And I think I was influenced by Maine, ocean or sky, or dark night. Yeah, definitely have a different color palette since I lived in Maine. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hanako’s style is rooted in Japan too. One of her guiding philosophies to lead with your heart and your body rather than your mind doesn’t just show up in her process. It’s embedded in the name of her studio, Mono Hanako.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Mono” means “thing” in Japanese. “Pottery” in Japanese is called “yakimono.” “Yaki” is “fired,” “mono” is “thing.” But I want my pottery to be versatile. If you call this a mug, it limits the usage function as a drinking vessel, maybe just for coffee or tea. But if you call it a thing, you could use it for soup, or you could use it for ice cream, dessert bowl, or you could put, you know, a bouquet of herbs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So it will open up the other possibilities of usage. So I want to call my pottery a thing, rather than giving a special name like a soup bowl or a dessert bowl or you know, ramen bowl. Because beyond that, people cannot really think about it. You know, oh, you have to use for ramen only. The pottery might be the same, but if you put different things, this will look differently. And I like the continuous change.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Trying to avoid the limiting confines of your thinking mind, staying away from perfection, celebrating and embracing variety, like the variety found in the tableware in a traditional Japanese meal. All this is baked into Hanukkah’s philosophy, not just in art, but in life.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think there is a Zen influence. Perfection is often avoided in Zen philosophy.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in Maine, that variety, that ruggedness, that beautiful imperfection is all around her.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Hanako:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Nature is not trying to be perfect. It just—it’s there.</span></p>\n<p><strong><em>Listen and subscribe on</em></strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-atlas-obscura-podcast/id1555769970\"> <strong><em>Apple Podcasts</em></strong></a><strong><em>,</em></strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0s0c4Z99PwbW8efTmHckyT\"> <strong><em>Spotify</em></strong></a><strong><em>, and all major podcast apps.</em></strong></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode was produced by Katie Thornton.

There’s a place you can go to cool off, get a drink and a snack, but it is not easy to find.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar Mercado:</strong> It’s in a cul-de-sac, so nobody will go there unless you had to. It is hidden away.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Down that cul-de-sac next to a daycare center, there’s a yellow sign in front of what looks like a bunch of trees. Follow the path next to the sign, and it will take you back to this little yellow bungalow with rocking chairs on a front porch, surrounded by tropical plants.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar: </strong>You’ll know you’re in the right place because of what it sounds like. We have the sound of the coquí frog on the outside of the store.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>That sound is playing over outdoor speakers.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar:</strong> It’s named coqui because that’s the sound it makes. It literally sings “coqui, coqui, coqui,” all night long. And when it’s raining, it sings that all night long.</p>\n<p>You either love it or it drives you crazy. But most Puerto Ricans love it. My mother hates it, but most Puerto Ricans love it.</p>\n<p>So when people come in, they hear the sound, and that’s also very emotional for us Puerto Ricans to hear that sound. Sometimes they sit on the rocking chairs and they’re like, this is what I used to do at my grandmother’s house, and listen to the coquí, and they just break down crying, which is sweet. It’s very sweet.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>I’m Kelly McCovers, and this is <em>Atlas Obscura</em>, a celebration of the world’s strange, incredible, and wondrous places. This episode is brought to you in partnership with Experience Kissimmee.</p>\n<p>The sound of the coquí frog is something that comforts people. And it makes sense that this snack shop, Coquí Snacks, is all about comfort foods. For 16 years, owner Dorimar Mercado has been sharing the snacks and sounds of her childhood in Puerto Rico with people who come to her shop.</p>\n<p>And those snacks include a frozen treat with a surprising connection to the aviator, Charles Lindbergh.

But in the last decade, the area has become a center of Latin American culture and food. Brazilian barbecue, Cuban sandwiches, sushi with Dominican flavors.</p>\n<p>And if you go to Kissimmee, about a 20-minute drive from Disney World, you will find this place called Coquí Snacks. You might think you just walked into the backyard of someone’s grandparents’ house in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar:</strong> The vibe is very nostalgic. The actual building, I made it look like a little Puerto Rican country house, like a wooden country house. That’s what it looks like.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> This is Dorimar Mercado, the founder of Coquí Snacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar: </strong>It’s small and cozy, and it has an area with rocking chairs, and it just gives you that Caribbean vibe.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Today, if you go to Coquí, you’ll find people hanging out on the front porch, sitting in the rocking chairs, many of them having the house specialty.</p>\n<p>It looks a little bit like a frozen ice pop in a cup. It’s a classic Puerto Rican snack called limbers, which have a surprising backstory. The name limber actually comes from Lindbergh, as in Charles Lindbergh, the aviator. He visited Puerto Rico back in 1928, flying his famous airplane, the Spirit of St. Louis.</p>\n<p>According to some versions of the story, Lindbergh arrived on a super hot day. Someone offered him a popsicle. He loved it. The name kind of stuck. But in other versions of the story …</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar:</strong> Puerto Ricans felt that he was a very aloof man. He didn’t show emotions that much. So he was very cold to the Puerto Rican people. And so Puerto Ricans started calling these desserts that probably were being called something like a little ice cream or something. And then we started calling them limber because they were as cold as Charles Lindbergh.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> So, whichever version of the story is true, limbers were what you had as a kid. Like when Dorimar was growing up.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar:</strong> In Puerto Rico, usually limbers were something that housewives made for a little extra cash, and they sold them from their houses, from their freezers. As a child, you would go to the lady that sold limbers, and then the lady would come out, usually in a bad mood.</p>\n<p>I never met a limber lady that was in a good mood because the kids were always bothering her somehow. You know, she was doing something or watching her telenovelas, and the kids were, you know, interrupting her. So she was like, “Yes?” you know, like, “Que?”</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> Lucky for her, Dorimar had a better source for limber.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar: </strong>In my grandmother’s backyard, she had coconut palm trees. So I would ask for a coconut limber, and she would just go to her backyard and throw rocks at the coconuts. The coconuts would fall, and she would make me limbers of coconuts. And so things like that, and that’s how limbers became a thing in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Then around 2008, Dorimar was living in the U.S. and working as a business journalist, but she started to worry about the future of newspapers and thought about trying something different. She ended up buying a kit online to make mini donuts and started selling them at fairs and events around Kissimmee. And it worked. By 2009, she was ready to open a shop. Kissimmee seemed like the perfect spot.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar:</strong> Kissimmee specifically, we have a large Puerto Rican community here.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Some say this started in the early ’70s when Disney World opened. The park needed workers, and at the time there was an economic downturn in Puerto Rico. Then, after Hurricane Maria in 2017, a lot of Puerto Ricans relocated to Central Florida. And now more than half the city’s population of 85,000 identifies as Puerto Rican. This was on Dorimar’s mind when she was thinking about how to expand her menu in the new location.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar: </strong>I was looking for things that I couldn’t find here as a Puerto Rican. And I thought of the limbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> At first, she started with traditional flavors coconut, pineapple, sour sap, mantecado, or vanilla cream. But over the years …</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar: </strong>We start getting more creative. At some point, I had them made out of different candy bars, like Snickers bars, Twix bars. And now, for example, Bad Bunny, the singer with his old residency in Puerto Rico and his new album, he has a song that’s called Cafe Con Ron. So we made a limber of Cafe Con Ron, a coffee and rum limber, and people love it.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> In the beginning, Coquí Snacks was all about sweets, but Dorimar says after customers started asking her for more savory options, she hit up her mom for recipes and learned some new ones on YouTube. So, today you can find fried fritters with all kinds of different fillings.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar: </strong>The crowd favorite for the frituras has always been the alcapurria de massa, which is the one made out of the green plantains with ground beef. People love the one that we make. That’s our number one bestseller, is that, and the empanadilla de pizza. The pizza empanada was a classic that all Puerto Rican kids grew up in.</p>\n<p>When I was going to school in Puerto Rico in the ’80s, they would have like a little kiosk with sweets and fried foods for the children. For a dollar, you could get a Coke icy and a pizza empanada.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Dorimar also has some of her own inventions. Like she took a traditional sandwich called a tripleta made with three different kinds of meats and stuffed it into an empanada.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar: </strong>Yeah, we tried to make new combinations. I would have new staff members come and say, hey, in my neighborhood, they used to make them out of this. And I say, well, okay, let’s try that and let’s see how we can change it and make it our own.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly:</strong> When Dorimar opened Coquí Snacks back in 2009, her oldest daughter was four, and she was pregnant with her youngest.</p>\n<p><strong>Dorimar:</strong> It was important to me as a mom to these two girls that were born here in the States to also get a little bit of their culture, you know, of where I come from. I’ve noticed that with a lot of parents also, that they love to bring their children and teach them, you know, this is what I used to eat when I was a child, you know, and now I had kids that used to come in with their parents, and because we’ve been over for 16 years, now they’re bringing their own babies, you know.</p>\n<p>So, other than making me feel old, it makes me feel proud also. I love, you know, that when you go to different places, you know, Italians keep some of their foods and, or the Irish, you know, that we’re all Americans, but we bring that deliciousness from all our countries. It’s all these traditions, all these little things that um we used to enjoy over there, and bringing it over here and teaching it to a new generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Kelly: </strong>Coquí snacks is open daily. Check out their hours online, and you can order on their website if you’re in the Kissimmee area. The shop is in a cul-de-sac. Look for the yellow sign. You know you’re getting close when you hear the sound, “coquí.”</p>\n<p>And if you’re looking for more places to eat while you’re in town, check out the <a href=\"https://kissimmee-latin-culinary-trail.atlasobscura.com/\">Kissimmee Latin Culinary Trail</a>.

The city had a number of apothecaries with soda fountains, as well as confectioners serving countless carbonated concoctions—some claiming to cure a variety of ailments, and others simply providing customers with something sweet and refreshing to drink.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter the nectar soda. The flavor is a combination of vanilla and bitter almond, and the drink is pastel pink in color—a nod to the hue of almond flowers, according to </span><a href=\"https://dannwoellertthefoodetymologist.wordpress.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dann Woellert</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Cincinnati food historian, etymologist, and the author of </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cincinnati-Candy-History-American-Palate/dp/1467137952\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cincinnati Candy: A Sweet History</span></em></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The only other U.S. city to embrace nectar sodas was New Orleans, but unlike Cincinnati, the tradition fizzled out in the Big Easy in the mid-20th century. Plus, Woellert says that the Queen City popularized them first. “They were served in Cincinnati nearly a decade before New Orleans,” he says.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Cincinnati nectar soda has multiple origin stories, each crediting a different pharmacist or confectioner, Woellert has concluded that </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/april-13-1947-page-98-151/docview/1882885311/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Mullane</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> created the flavor after traveling to Quebec City to learn the art of confectionery from a prominent Canadian candymaker. He began serving nectar sodas in his confectionery shop in downtown Cincinnati in the late 1870s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, why did the nectar soda end up in Cincinnati and New Orleans, of all places? Wollert suspects that the bitter almond and vanilla flavor was used by the French Acadians who settled in both Quebec City and New Orleans.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though nectar sodas aren’t as common as they were in the early 20th century, when they could be found at countless confectioneries and pharmacy soda fountains across Cincinnati, they’re still served at establishments throughout the city and the surrounding area. Nectar sodas have been on the menu at ice cream and chocolate shop </span><a href=\"https://www.aglamesis.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aglamesis Brothers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since it opened in Cincinnati in 1908, if not shortly thereafter. That’s according to company president and CEO Randy Young, who is also a third-generation family member. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s unclear when nectar sodas were added to the </span><a href=\"https://digital.cincinnatilibrary.org/digital/collection/p16998coll32/id/2220/rec/19\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">menu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><a href=\"https://www.graeters.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graeter’s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Cincinnati ice cream and chocolate shop that opened in 1870 and now has locations throughout the city and the Midwest, but Chip Graeter, chief of retail operations and a fourth-generation family member, says that they were especially popular throughout the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/january-28-1947-page-2-26/docview/1882876222/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">January 28, 1947 article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cincinnati Enquirer</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Tom Moore, the head of the soda department at Dow Drug Store—which operated 32 soda fountains throughout the metropolitan area at that time—said that “nectar is one of the most popular flavors in all of their stores, and has been for many years.” Five years prior, </span><a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/hnpcincinnatienquirershell/historical-newspapers/august-16-1942-page-63-99/docview/1882739776/sem-2?accountid=39387\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow ran an ad</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the same newspaper which read: “Be glad you live in Cincinnati, the only place in the country where you can enjoy a Dow double-dip nectar soda.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Originally, nectar syrup was made by combining half-and-half or milk with water, bitter almond extract, vanilla extract and red food coloring. While Aglamesis eventually switched to a dairy-free shelf-stable syrup, Graeter's recipe has never changed—it still contains milk and needs to be refrigerated. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Aglamesis and Graeter’s make nectar soda by mixing nectar syrup with a dollop of whipped cream, adding a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream, then topping it off with some soda water and more whipped cream.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Young says that nectar sodas are most popular with older adults, they’re also a hit with members of younger generations who try them. “People who grew up with them still love them today,” Graeter says. “We still make them in all of our stores, but they're not nearly as popular today as they once were, simply because milkshakes and smoothies have taken over.”  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Young, there is a commercially available descendant of </span><a href=\"https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/barq-s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the nectar soda</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “Commercial soda companies like Barqs and others came out with their version of cream soda—a bright pink soda—which got its flavoring from nectar soda,” he explains.</span></p>",

Serving the commuter rail, the orange line connecting to North Station, and a stop for Amtrak, there is no shortage of foot traffic. Within the waiting area for Amtrak departures, there is a large statue of a man in a sitting pose with informational guides posted nearby. Most commuters probably don’t notice it, but the man depicted played a significant role in shaping worker’s rights and civil rights during the 20th century. </p>\n<p>Asa Philip Randolph was born in Crescent City, Florida on April 15, 1889. His family moved to Jacksonville, Florida in 1891 and growing up in the South, Randolph witnessed Jim Crow firsthand and learned from his parents the importance of education, self-defense, character, and conduct. He attended the Cookman Institute in East Jacksonville and graduated as the valedictorian for the class of 1907. Randolph read W.E.B. Du Bois’ book <em>The Souls of Black Folk,</em> which convinced him to become a fighter for social equality. However, with all jobs except manual labor off limits for African Americans, Randolph moved to New York City in 1911. </p>\n<p>Shortly after arriving in New York, Randolph helped organize the Shakespearean Society in Harlem and became involved in many socialist political movements. In 1917, he and fellow activist Chandler Owen founded the magazine <em>The Messenger </em>which advocated against lynching, US participation in World War I, fighting for a more integrated society, and for Black Americans to join unions. In the early 1920s, Randolph ran for local government offices on the socialist platform but was unsuccessful. In 1925, he founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first labor union led by Black Americans to receive a charter in the American Federation of Labor. Randolph campaigned extensively for workers of the Pullman Company, a manufacturer of railroad cars and a major employer of African Americans at the time. After the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Pullman Company began to negotiate with the Brotherhood and settled on a contract in 1937 which guaranteed higher wages, overtime pay, and a shorter workweek. </p>\n<p>In addition to labor unions, Randolph also worked extensively for civil rights in the United States. He worked closely with President Roosevelt during the Second World War to address racial discrimination in the war industry and to ensure Black Americans had the equal opportunity to serve their country. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in June 1941 which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry and the government backed Black workers during the Philadelphia Transit Strike in 1944. After the war, Randolph continued to work with the next administration and in 1948, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981 which abolished segregation in the US military. Once the Civil Rights Movement began in the 1950s, Randolph was a key figure and formed an important alliance with Martin Luther King Jr. in 1957. On August 28, 1963, Randolph was one of the leaders during the March on Washington where King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech which had a significant impact on the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. </p>\n<p>On May 16, 1979, Randolph passed away inside his Manhattan apartment. On October 8, 1988, a group of retired Pullman car porters and dining car waiters gathered at Back Bay station to unveil a statue dedicated to Randolph who worked so hard on their behalf decades ago. The sculpture is located within a waiting area with many plaques and informational signs posted. If you would like to learn more about Randolph, his life, and his contributions, it’s definitely worth taking a look next time you’re at Back Bay station. </p>",

At CES 2026, that meant new flagship productivity machines, reconsidered gaming notebooks and solid incremental updates across several major lineups. While we’re still seeing embargoes lift and hands-on time on the show floor, the announcements below reflect the most significant laptops we’ve seen so far. Plus, the list will grow as more companies reveal details throughout January 6 and beyond.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable\">Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable</h2><figure><img alt=\"Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/6fe343d0-eb88-11f0-abbf-1a7759f06b4d\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><p>Lenovo came prepared for CES 2026 with a ton of laptops — concepts, fully-formed designs and everything in betwee. The most striking concept was the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable-concept-goes-big-wide-at-the-touch-of-a-button-010000333.html\" target=\"_blank\">Legion Pro Rollable</a>, a gaming laptop built around a flexible OLED panel that expands sideways from a standard 16-inch footprint to 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches, shifting aspect ratios from 16:10 to 21:9 or even 24:9. It’s the kind of idea that makes immediate sense for flight sims, racing games and open-world titles that benefit from ultrawide views, even if the mechanics felt a bit prototype-like up close.</p><p>Lenovo also showed the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html\" target=\"_blank\">XD Rollable concept</a>, which takes a more familiar rollable approach, expanding a 13.3-inch OLED screen to 16 inches at the push of a button. The twist is that the “extra” display wraps around the back of the lid to create a world-facing surface for mirrored content or a secondary view.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-samsung-galaxy-book6-series\">Samsung Galaxy Book6 series</h2><figure><img alt=\"New Samsung Galaxy Book6 laptops offer NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/9dce55c0-eab9-11f0-bef9-b1978212f09b\" style=\"height: 1125px; width: 2000px;\" /><figcaption>New Samsung Galaxy Book6 laptops offer NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>Samsung announced the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsungs-galaxy-book-6-series-ces-2026-intel-panther-lake-230010324.html\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Book6 family at CES 2026</a>, introducing three new laptops built around Intel’s Panther Lake chips: the Galaxy Book6, Book6 Pro and Book6 Ultra. The focus this year is on slimmer designs, improved thermals and longer battery life, with Samsung claiming up to 30 hours of video playback on the Book6 Ultra and Pro.</p><p>The 16-inch Galaxy Book6 Ultra sits at the top of the lineup, with configurations offering up to Intel Core Ultra X9 processors, Intel Arc graphics and NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, including RTX 5070 and RTX 5060 options. Samsung says the Ultra delivers up to 1.6x better CPU performance and 1.7x improved graphics compared with the previous Galaxy Book generation, helped by a wider vapor chamber and a new dual-path fan system for GPU cooling.</p><p>Both the Book6 Ultra and Book6 Pro feature upgraded 2,880 x 1,800 AMOLED 2X displays with touch support, adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz and peak brightness of up to 1,000 nits. The laptops are thinner than their predecessors, with the Ultra measuring 15.4mm thick and the Pro coming in at 11.9mm — and Samsung has added haptic trackpads across the series for the first time.

Unlike productivity-focused dual-screen systems, the Zephyrus Duo is positioned as a hybrid machine designed to handle gaming, content creation and multitasking in a single portable setup.</p><p>Both 16-inch Nebula OLED panels support HDR with up to 1,100 nits of peak brightness, NVIDIA G-SYNC, stylus input and high color accuracy. Performance comes from Intel’s latest Core Ultra processors paired with NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs, up to an RTX 5090. While the system’s 135W power budget means it won’t match the raw performance of some single-screen gaming laptops, ASUS is clearly prioritizing versatility over maximum output.</p><p>The Zephyrus Duo includes a detachable wireless keyboard, a built-in kickstand and multiple usage modes, including stacked dual-screen layouts and drawing configurations. Despite weighing a whopping 6.28 pounds, ASUS has kept the chassis relatively slim at 0.77 inches and equipped it with a six-speaker system, vapor chamber cooling and a broad selection of ports including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1 and a full-size SD card slot.

As with the ultra-slim model, full details are expected later this year.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-alienware-area-51-and-aurora\">Alienware Area-51 and Aurora</h2><p>Alongside its new teasers, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/alienware-teases-new-super-slim-and-entry-level-gaming-laptops-at-ces-2026-033000700.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alienware announced updates to several existing laptops</a>. The Alienware 16X Aurora and Alienware 16 Area-51 are gaining new anti-glare OLED panels with up to 620 nits of peak HDR brightness and a 0.2ms response time, as well as Intel Core Ultra 200HX processors.</p><p>The Alienware 18 Area-51 is also being refreshed with the same CPUs. Alienware says the updated Alienware 16X Aurora, Alienware 16 Area-51 and Alienware 18 Area-51 laptops will be available in Q1 2026. Pricing has not yet been announced.</p><p></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/all-the-laptops-that-caught-our-eye-at-ces-2026-160610752.html?src=rss",

That's because <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces-2026/\" target=\"_blank\">CES 2026</a> is in full swing, with all manner of companies descending on Las Vegas to reveal their latest innovations and what they're planning to bring your way in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the Engadget crew are on the ground to check out as much of the new tech as possible. Of course, we're keeping tabs on all of the major CES press conferences too. Samsung held its First Look presentation, which focuses on home products, while LG has shown off a wide array of TVs and Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology. We’ve heard from the major chipmakers, gone hands-on with Samsung’s trifold phone, checked out some funky laptops and seen some cute robots. There’s some hot gaming tech at the show too.</p><p>You can catch up on all of the big CES 2026 announcements (and some of the more offbeat gizmos we’ve seen) right here. We'll be keeping this story updated throughout the week.&nbsp;We also have <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ces-2026-live-updates-on-lego-samsung-nvidia-dell-and-more-153146039.html\" target=\"_blank\">CES live updates</a>, with all the latest news from the event.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-lego\">Lego</h2><figure><img alt=\"Lego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/SMARTBrick_16x9.jpg\" style=\"height: 2160px; width: 3840px;\" /><figcaption>Lego introduced the Smart Brick at CES 2026.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Lego</div></figure><p>In its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/follow-the-lego-ces-2026-press-conference-live-right-here-130005940.html\" target=\"_blank\">first CES appearance</a>, Lego announced the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-unveils-a-technology-packed-smart-brick-at-ces-2026-190000511.html\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Brick</a>, a standard-sized brick with a 4.1mm ASIC chip inside that’s designed to respond in different ways depending on what set you’re building and how you’re building it. Using what Lego calls the “Play Engine” and integrated copper coils, each brick can sense things like motion, orientation and magnetic fields, plus its own distance, direction and orientation in relation to other Smart Bricks. Each brick also has a teeny tiny speaker built in that will play audio “tied to live play actions” rather than only pre-recorded clips.</p><p>Accompanying Smart Bricks are Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures, which have their own capabilities — one of which is letting Smart Bricks know what context they are being used in. All of these pieces tie together via a local wireless layer dubbed BrickNet that, in part, lets Smart Bricks know where they are placed in relation to other smart components. </p><p>The first “<a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=fd3b4bbf-1b78-4e34-9914-70a2e6f85389&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;linkText=Smart+Play&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9zbWFydC1wbGF5IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmZDNiNGJiZi0xYjc4LTRlMzQtOTkxNC03MGEyZTZmODUzODkiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL3NtYXJ0LXBsYXkifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUtpF6P2TEsufMRmdxeGT4PbJA8qivZgoVfsF5cuft7l&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fsmart-play\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Play</a>” partner is, unsurprisingly, Star Wars, which will launch three “all-in-one” sets using Smart Bricks, Smart Tags and Smart Minifigures. The 473-piece Darth Vader TIE Fighter set will cost $70; the 584-piece Luke’s Red Five X-Wing set comes in at $100 and the 962-piece Throne Room Duel &amp; A-wing set will set you back $160. The speakers in these sets can emit lightsaber swooshes, fighter sounds and <em>The Imperial March</em>.</p><p>Engadget deputy editor Nathan Ingraham got to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-smart-play-hands-on-using-technology-to-get-kids-to-play-together-133000436.html\" target=\"_blank\">check out Lego’s Smart Play system in person</a> and I’ve never been more envious of him. One of the Star Wars sets allows you to have an interactive lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Not only does the Vader minifigure have his signature heavy breathing sound, the speaker emits the Sith Lord’s “nooooo” yell if he loses the duel.</p><p>All of this seems extremely cool. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Lego and fans can do with the Smart Play tech.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-lg\">LG</h2><figure><img alt=\"LG&amp;#39;s CLOiD robot.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cloid_laundry.jpg\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>LG&amp;#39;s CLOiD robot.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LG</div></figure><p>Likewise, LG brought other non-TV tech to CES.

This year’s edition was laregly a recap of the company’s recent moves, but it did have <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/everything-nvidia-announced-at-ces-2026-225653684.html\" target=\"_blank\">some news to share</a>.</p><p>NVIDIA announced Alpamayo, which is a group of open-source reasoning models designed to help autonomous vehicles handle difficult driving scenarios. The company also revealed that a super computer built on the Vera Rubin GPU architecture NVIDIA unveiled in 2024 is in production. </p><figure><img alt=\"As Intel wraps up, Johnson is eager to assure the viewers that Intel has ways to make AI profitable.

These are the first chips to be built using Intel’s 18A (18 angstroms, which is just under 2nm) process. The company says they offer improved performance — 60 percent more than the previous-gen Lunar Lake processors — and battery life improvements for laptops. </p><p>The Ultra Series 3 includes a new Arc B390 integrated GPU, with 50 percent more graphics cores, double the cache and 120 GPU TOPS of performance. Put all that together and these chips should deliver up to 77 percent faster gaming performance than Lunar Lake models, Intel said. To that end, the company teased a Ultra Series 3-powered gaming handheld for later this year.</p><p>Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar played some <em>Battlefield 6</em> on a Core Ultra Series 3-powered Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 (an ultraportable) and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/intels-core-ultra-series-3-let-me-play-battlefield-6-at-190-fps-on-a-lenovo-ultraportable-220952246.html\" target=\"_blank\">came away impressed</a>. The game ran at up to 190 fps in 1080p with the graphics settings on high, even without a dedicated GPU.  That’s a promising sign for the embedded Arc&nbsp;graphics on Intel’s chips, as well as the company’s upscaling and frame generation tech.</p><figure><img alt=\"A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/8b508280-eaa8-11f0-bffb-7903d4a9ed90\" style=\"height: 1916px; width: 3444px;\" /><figcaption>A screenshot from AMD's CES 2026 press conference showing a hellish vision of the future of gaming.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">AMD</div></figure><p>Of course, AMD wasn’t going to be left out of the CES party.

The company revealed the Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at the show. It’s more of a mid-range chip that isn’t quite as powerful as the higher end Snapdragon X2 Elite — it doesn’t have as many CPU cores, for one thing. Still, Qualcomm claims the X2 Plus offers as much as 35 percent faster single-core performance over the previous gen. The company also says the Adreno GPU offers a performance boost of up to 29 percent compared with the last generation.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-laptops\">Laptops </h2><figure><img alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-on\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/f9e798a0-ea85-11f0-bbd1-8dfc40a2d49e\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>Samsung Galaxy Book 6 series hands-on</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure><p>What would CES be without some new hardware that makes use of those new chips?

Micro RGB is a new tech that's similar to Mini LED, though it uses red, green and blue LEDs instead of white backlights. Contrast ratios aren't quite as high as those on Micro LED and OLED displays, since the pixels can't be turned on and off individually. However, Micro RGB units are said to be brighter and more color accurate than TVs that use other display tech, in part because the LEDs in these screens offer smaller, more customizable dimming zones.&nbsp;<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/what-are-micro-rgb-tvs-and-why-are-they-everywhere-at-ces-2026-182441543.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read reporter Steve Dent’s explainer</a> for a deeper dive into how Micro RGB differs from other types of display tech.</p><p>We're seeing more of these TVs pop up at CES 2026, including a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-brought-an-absolute-beast-of-a-130-inch-micro-rgb-tv-to-ces-2026-060245387.html\" target=\"_blank\">mammoth 130-inch concept model</a> that <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/samsung-will-show-off-its-expanded-micro-rgb-tv-series-at-ces-141716449.html\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung brought to Las Vegas</a>.

The UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor has a nifty feature in that it's possible to hook up four PCs simultaneously and give each a dedicated section of the display — that could make co-op games pretty fun if you're dedicated enough to try that set up. It's possible to control all four connected PCs with a single mouse and keyboard too. This monitor is available now for $2,900 with a stand and $2,800 without.</p><p>Dell also showed off a new 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor with Dolby Vision and True Black 500 HDR support. The Dell UltraSharp 32 4K QD-OLED Monitor can be all yours for $2,600 as of February 24.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/samsungs-latest-odyssey-gaming-monitor-has-a-32-inch-6k-screen-with-glasses-free-3d-130051748.html\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lg-announces-line-of-premium-gaming-monitors-that-offer-5k-visuals-165224945.html\" target=\"_blank\">LG</a> revealed some new gaming monitors ahead of CES.

At $369, that seems like a pretty decent option if you’re looking for an entry-level projector you can take anywhere. The P1i should arrive in time for camping trips too, since Soundcore says it’ll be available in the early part of this year. The brand also said its higher-end Nebula X1 Pro, a version of its 4K Nebula X1 that includes a 160W surround sound system, will be available this month for $4,999.</p><p>XGIMI was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/xgimis-titan-noir-max-4k-projector-has-a-dynamic-iris-for-increased-contrast-170044625.html\" target=\"_blank\">also at CES</a> to show off its latest high-end projector, the Titan Noir Max.

DLSS 4.5 is said to offer sharper visuals thanks to the 2nd Generation Super Resolution Transformer, which is available now for all RTX GPUs. NVIDIA says this offers better temporal stability, reduced ghosting and improved anti-aliasing.</p><p>On GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, DLSS 4.5 will be able to generate up to five extra frames for each traditionally rendered one and deliver up to 4K 240Hz path traced performance, NVIDIA says. The Dynamic 6x Frame Generation feature will be available for those graphics cards sometime this spring.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>NVIDIA also <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-tech-can-minimize-motion-blur-for-gamers-140000058.html\" target=\"_blank\">detailed</a> a new version of its G-Sync variable refresh rate tech. It says that G-Sync Pulsar can minimize motion blur by effectively quadrupling your refresh rate. So 250 Hz gameplay will seemingly offer up a perceived effective motion clarity of over 1,000 Hz with G-Sync Pulsar enabled. </p><p>You’ll need a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible display to use this feature. Most displays have a backlight that’s always on, so images fade from one frame to the next. On G-Sync Pulsar displays, there are several horizontal backlight sections. The backlights pulse from top to bottom. This is said to help the pixels in each frame stabilize before they’re backlit, resulting in lower motion blur. </p><p>It’s interesting stuff. Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI are each releasing a G-Sync Pulsar-compatible 27-inch monitor this week.</p><figure><img alt=\"8BitDo FlipPad\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/66a8a0f0-ea3c-11f0-bfee-7797bdd266e8\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1530px;\" /><figcaption>8BitDo FlipPad</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">8BitDo</div></figure><p>The <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/8bitdo-is-unveiling-a-new-mobile-gaming-pad-at-ces-134555603.html\" target=\"_blank\">FlipPad</a> is one of my favorite things I’ve seen coming out of CES this year. It’s an 8BitDo mobile game controller that’s designed for vertical use.

But many mobile games are played with the phone oriented to the vertical position. And that’s not to mention emulators that allow you to play the likes of Game Boy titles while your phone stands tall. So it’s neat to see 8BitDo offering a physical controller that’ll do the trick.

You’ll be able to slot those devices into the X5 Alteron’s grip (as you might with a Backbone or Razer Kishi controller) though there’s a Bluetooth option for PC gaming too. The magnetic modules include ones styled after the GameCube and Nintendo 64, and there’ll be one with a trackpad that’s made with first-person shooters in mind. There’s no pricing or release date for the X5 Alteron yet, but I’m eager to try it.</p><p>Elsewhere on the gaming front, Lenovo revealed a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-reveals-a-steamos-variant-of-the-legion-go-2-at-ces-010000852.html\" target=\"_blank\">SteamOS-powered version of the Legion Go 2</a>.

They’re the company’s first open-ear earbuds with ANC. You can snap them up in February for $180. There’s also a new portable Bluetooth speaker from Anker called the Soundcore Boom Go 3i. It’s a 15W unit with (according to Anker) up to 22 hours of battery life, and it should cost between $65 and $80 when it drops in March. </p><p>Engadget deputy editor Billy Steele has been checking out some of the audio gear at CES, including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/ces-2026-shokz-new-earbuds-effectively-reduce-noise-while-keeping-your-ears-open-080000996.html\" target=\"_blank\">Shokz’ $250 OpenFit Pro earbuds</a>, which have Dolby Atmos support. Billy has also had some hands-on (or heads-on) time with Klipsch’s first new headphones in years. There are initially three models in the company’s Atlas series, including the Atlas HP-1, a wireless set with ANC that has a lovely wood finish on the exterior of the earcups. Klipsch is only allowing demos with lossless audio over USB-C for now, but the audio quality is “excellent,” Billy wrote in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/klipsch-atlas-hp-1-hands-on-a-return-to-hi-fi-headphones-at-ces-2026-130000415.html\" target=\"_blank\">his hands-on story</a>. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/everything-announced-at-ces-2026-130124802.html?src=rss",

NVIDIA announced important gaming news, we caught up with Samsung’s tri-fold phone and Lenovo marched out an army of impressive looking gaming laptops and concept tech. Here are the biggest stories from January 6.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-nvidia\">NVIDIA</h2><figure><img alt=\"NVIDIA's G-Sync Pulsar is the next evolution of its VRR technology.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/nvidia-gsync-pulsar.jpeg\" style=\"height: 973px; width: 1600px;\" /><figcaption>NVIDIA's G-Sync Pulsar is the next evolution of its VRR technology.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">NVIDIA</div></figure><p>NVIDIA’s gaming updates focused on making motion look cleaner and boosting performance without forcing developers to rebuild everything from scratch.</p><p>The company introduced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-tech-can-minimize-motion-blur-for-gamers-140000058.html\" target=\"_blank\">G-Sync Pulsar</a>, a new display tech designed to reduce monitor-based motion blur by pulsing a screen’s backlight in sections rather than leaving it on continuously. NVIDIA says the approach gives pixels time to stabilize before they’re illuminated, which should make fast movement easier to track, particularly in esports.</p><p>The first Pulsar monitors are expected to come out starting January 7 from Acer, AOC, ASUS and MSI, all which are 27-inch 1440p IPS panels with a 360Hz refresh rate and up to 500 nits peak HDR brightness. Pulsar models also support Ambient Adaptive Technology for automatic color temperature and brightness adjustment based on room lighting.</p><p>On the software side, NVIDIA announced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nvidia-announces-dlss-45-at-ces-2026-053000128.html\" target=\"_blank\">DLSS 4.5</a>, which adds a second-generation Transformer-based Super Resolution model the company says improves temporal stability, reduces ghosting and improves anti-aliasing. DLSS 4.5 also introduces Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, intended to push performance toward your display’s refresh rate, with NVIDIA positioning it around high-end targets like 4K 240Hz path tracing. The 2nd Gen Super Resolution Transformer model is available now for RTX GPUs, while Dynamic 6x Frame Generation is expected in spring 2026 for RTX 50-series cards, with support rolling out across hundreds of games via the NVIDIA app.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-samsung\">Samsung</h2><figure><img alt=\"The Galaxy Z TriFold is the latest evolution in Samsung's growing lineup of fancy foldable phones.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/TriFold-lead.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>The Galaxy Z TriFold is the latest evolution in Samsung's growing lineup of fancy foldable phones.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on-flexing-is-believing-at-ces-2026-224343480.html\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung’s Galaxy Z TriFold</a> was unveiled in Asia before the show, but this was our first opportunity to see the superphone in person. It looked, at first glance, like the kind of idea that comes with obvious compromises: more weight, more thickness and a bigger price tag. In person, the pitch becomes easier to understand.</p><p>The main draw is the 10-inch AMOLED display, which is a meaningful leap from the 8-inch inner screen on Samsung’s current book-style foldables. That extra real estate makes multitasking feel less cramped, and when paired with DeX, it starts to resemble a travel-friendly laptop alternative if you’re comfortable carrying a small keyboard and mouse. The TriFold’s 4:3 aspect ratio also helps for video and general productivity, with fewer awkward tradeoffs than the squarer inner screens Samsung has leaned on in recent generations.</p><p>Samsung appears to have put real effort into the mechanics, too. The device uses two hinges and a magnet system designed to make opening and closing feel intuitive, with built-in warnings if you try to unfold it the wrong way. The obvious downsides are still there, including the bulk and cost, and it’s not clear how much thinner future versions can get when the USB-C port is effectively the limiting factor. For now, the TriFold is on sale in South Korea, with US and broader North American availability and pricing still pending.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-lenovo\">Lenovo</h2><figure><img alt=\"While it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept's screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Legion-Pro-rollable-lead.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>While it normally has a 16-inch display, the Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable concept's screen can expand up to 23.8 inches across.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Lenovo arrived with a stack of concepts and a few more concrete products, making it clear that the company is still treating CES as its main playground for experimental form factors.</p><p>The most striking concept was the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-legion-pro-rollable-concept-goes-big-wide-at-the-touch-of-a-button-010000333.html\" target=\"_blank\">Legion Pro Rollable</a>, a gaming laptop built around a flexible OLED panel that expands sideways from a standard 16-inch footprint to 21.5 inches or 23.8 inches, shifting aspect ratios from 16:10 to 21:9 or even 24:9. It’s the kind of idea that makes immediate sense for flight sims, racing games and open-world titles that benefit from ultrawide views, even if the mechanics felt a bit prototype-like up close.</p><p>Lenovo also showed the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-goes-sci-fi-with-its-wild-xd-rollable-concept-at-ces-2026-010000817.html\" target=\"_blank\">XD Rollable concept</a>, which takes a more familiar rollable approach, expanding a 13.3-inch OLED screen to 16 inches at the push of a button. The twist is that the “extra” display wraps around the back of the lid to create a world-facing surface for mirrored content or a secondary view. It’s a clever way to avoid hiding unused panel real estate, even if the practical use cases still feel limited (maybe point-of-sale terminals?).</p><p>On the handheld front, Lenovo confirmed the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-reveals-a-steamos-variant-of-the-legion-go-2-at-ces-010000852.html\" target=\"_blank\">Legion Go 2</a>, which will be powered by SteamOS and will arrive in June starting at $1,199. It keeps the same core hardware, including an 8.8-inch OLED 144Hz VRR display, detachable controllers, a kickstand and two configuration tiers based on Ryzen Z2 chips. The big change is swapping SteamOS in place of Windows, which should appeal to anyone who wants a more console-like experience, even if it remains a large device at 2.2 pounds.</p><p>For laptops headed to market, Lenovo introduced the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/ces-2026-the-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-7-auto-twist-wont-let-you-out-of-it-sight-010000913.html\" target=\"_blank\">ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist</a>, a notebook with a motorized display that can follow you during calls and presentations using a 10MP webcam and onboard AI. It also supports Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors, up to 32GB RAM and 2TB storage, plus a strong port selection, and Lenovo says it starts at $1,649 with availability planned for June.</p><p>Finally, Lenovo teased an <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/lenovo-just-revealed-a-concept-for-ai-powered-smartglasses-at-ces-010057822.html\" target=\"_blank\">AI smart glasses concept</a> that looks more like normal eyewear than most show-floor prototypes. Lenovo says the glasses are designed for live translation, image recognition and notification summaries, with an eight-hour battery claim. As with many Lenovo concepts, there’s no firm timeline for a retail release.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-pebble\">Pebble</h2><figure><img alt=\"Image of two Pebble Round 2 units, one in silver, one in rose gold, side by side on a table.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Lede.jpg\" style=\"height: 1012px; width: 1800px;\" /><figcaption>The Pebble Round 2 reboots a smartwatch classic.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Daniel Cooper for Engadget</div></figure><p>Pebble’s presence at CES this year felt like a counterpoint to the “more features, more sensors, more subscriptions” direction of other wearables.</p><p>The <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebble-seeks-to-remedy-the-wearable-industrys-original-sin-170000834.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pebble Round 2</a> aims to revive the brand’s original appeal: a lightweight watch that supplements your phone rather than trying to replace it. The new model uses a 1.3-inch color e-paper touchscreen that runs to the edge of the case, with Pebble claiming two weeks of battery life in the 8.1mm-thick watch. It also makes deliberate tradeoffs, skipping GPS, a speaker and an optical heart rate sensor to keep the device thin and focused.</p><p>Then there’s the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/pebbles-founder-might-be-just-the-right-person-to-make-an-ai-ring-170104222.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pebble Index 01</a>, a simple AI ring built around a physical button you press to activate voice commands that you can use to ask questions, set reminders and the like. The pitch is reducing friction: no wake words, no gestures you have to get right every time. Pebble says the ring is water resistant and not rechargeable, instead using a sealed battery designed to last years depending on usage, with replacement handled when the battery is nearing the end of its life. It’s available for pre-order at an early bird price of $75, with shipping planned for May.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-segway\">Segway</h2><figure><img alt=\"undefined\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/bc715a50-e031-11f0-9bdb-be0ed2d0933b\" style=\"height: 5796px; width: 12881px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>Segway expanded its presence well beyond scooters with two very different pitches: smarter yard care and more tech-forward e-bikes.</p><p>Under its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/segways-navimow-brand-unveiled-a-new-line-of-robotic-lawn-mowers-at-ces-2026-130007014.html\" target=\"_blank\">Navimow brand</a>, Segway introduced a new lineup of robotic lawn mowers spanning multiple tiers, including the X4 Series for large yards up to 1.5 acres with AWD and dual cutting motors, plus the more mainstream i2 Series with AWD and LiDAR options. Segway says pre-orders for the i2 AWD and X4 models begin January 16, with pricing ranging from around $1,000 to $3,000 depending on configuration.</p><p>On the mobility side, Segway announced two new e-bikes, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/segway-launches-two-more-e-bikes-at-ces-130000152.html\" target=\"_blank\">Myon and Muxi</a>, along with an electric dirt bike called the Xaber 300. The headline is the company’s focus on sensor-driven ride smoothing, smart features like Find My integration and app-based controls, and tech meant to make starts, hills and traction feel more predictable. The Myon is available now for $2,000, while the Muxi is expected in March for $1,700.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-meta\">Meta</h2><figure><img alt=\"Meta's neural band in Garmin's Unified Cabin at CES 2026.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/garmin_band_demo_.jpg\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Meta's neural band in Garmin's Unified Cabin at CES 2026.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Karissa Bell for Engadget</div></figure><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/metas-emg-wristband-is-moving-beyond-its-ar-glasses-120000503.html\" target=\"_blank\">Meta’s EMG wristband</a> (that’s short for “electromyography,” the ability to recognize and translate small finger and wrist gestures) is starting to look like more than a companion accessory for smart glasses. Meta showed how its wrist-based neural controller could be used beyond its own eyewear, including an early demo with Garmin inside a concept car cockpit. The interaction was still basic — swipe and pinch gestures to navigate apps on an infotainment screen — but the larger idea is hands-free control of vehicle functions over time.</p><p>Meta also highlighted research work exploring how EMG control could help people with conditions that limit hand mobility interact with smart home devices like speakers, blinds and thermostats. If day one of the show had a theme beyond AI, it was that companies are still willing to gamble on new shapes and inputs, and they can work as long as they feel practical and immediately useful.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-razer\">Razer</h2><figure><img alt=\"Razer's concept immersive gaming chair with light strips along the head cushions is pictured in front of a desk in a rocky outdoor environment between large puddles\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Razer_Project_Madison.jpg\" style=\"height: 2160px; width: 3840px;\" /><figcaption>Razer's concept immersive gaming chair with light strips along the head cushions is pictured in front of a desk in a rocky outdoor environment between large puddles</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Razer</div></figure><p>Razer’s day-one news was split between a full-blown immersion concept and a more grounded chair refresh.</p><p>The company’s <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/razers-project-madison-concept-chair-has-reactive-lighting-immersive-audio-and-multi-zone-haptics-140000118.html\" target=\"_blank\">Project Madison</a> concept is a gaming chair designed as a multisensory rig, combining reactive lighting, spatial audio and multi-zone haptics to match on-screen action.

Agibot described the A2 as a potential hospitality helper for places like museums or conferences, while the X2 is framed more as an educational platform with slightly more human-like movement. Agibot also says its robots can learn actions from video, including training dance routines from TikTok clips, and the company plans to make its robots available in the US this year, though pricing and broader availability details weren’t shared.</p><p>Day one is in the books, but CES 2026 is far from over.

Sadly, it’s far easier to make something that can stir a pan of ingredients as they cook compared to building something that would successfully peel a carrot. Nosh is the latest unit to use CES to announce itself to the world, gearing up for its launch in the next few months. Like its many rivals, you load ingredients into the unit and then Nosh will assemble them for you. Unlike its many rivals, you can have more than one ingredient tray, opening up the possibility that you could prep multiple meals at the same time.</p><p>Even if you’re not familiar with the category you can guess how this thing works: You’ll select a recipe from the hardware’s 500-dish strong repertoire. Then you’ll prepare the necessary raw materials and slide them into individual compartments in the trays. Once done, you’ll be able to push the tray into the unit when you’re ready to eat and let it get on with the job of cooking. There are water and oil reservoirs,  a spice rack mounted in the top, and a camera that uses computer vision to keep an eye on the meals as they cook. As each morsel is added, a mixer arm spins to ensure the food never stays in one place for too long.&nbsp;</p><p>From the marketing materials (as well as my own common sense) it’s clear Nosh works best with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://us.letsnosh.io/recipes-nosh\" target=\"_blank\">sauce heavy meals</a>. Pasta dishes, soups and curries will work pretty well in the system, which may limit how often you’ll want to use it across a regular week. That said, the idea of having this as a low-effort alternative to pre-prepared meals from the oven or microwave is preferable. I’m just not sure how engaged I’ll be in finely julienning carrot batons after an 18-hour day at the content factory.</p><p>Nosh is launching in the near future but early birds can already put some cash down to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://get.letsnosh.io/reservation\" target=\"_blank\">get the unit for $1,200</a>, a deep discount on its $2,000 retail price.

A website can be included in the HSTS preload list by conforming to a set of requirements and then submitting itself to the list.</p> \n  <h6>Use Cases</h6> \n  <p>There are several reasons why it's important for a site to be HSTS enabled: 1. User bookmarks or manually types <a href=\"http://example.com\">http://example.com</a> and is subject to a man-in-the-middle attacker HSTS automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for the target domain 2. Web application that is intended to be purely HTTPS inadvertently contains HTTP links or serves content over HTTP HSTS automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for the target domain 3. A man-in-the-middle attacker attempts to intercept traffic from a victim user using an invalid certificate and hopes the user will accept the bad certificate HSTS does not allow a user to override the invalid certificate message</p> \n  <h6>Useful Links</h6> \n  <ul> \n   <li>[undefined](function link() { [native code] })</li> \n   <li>[undefined](function link() { [native code] })</li> \n   <li>[undefined](function link() { [native code] })</li> \n  </ul> \n </details> \n <details> \n  <b>DNS Server</b> \n  <img align=\"right\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/tKpL8F9/Screenshot-from-2023-08-12-15-43-12.png\" width=\"300\" /> \n  <h6>Description</h6> \n  <p>This check determines the DNS server(s) that the requested URL / IP resolves to.

It allows domain owners to specify how to handle unauthenticated mail via a published policy in DNS, and provides a way for receiving mail servers to send feedback about emails' compliance to the sender. BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification): BIMI is an emerging email standard that enables organizations to display a logo in their customers' email clients automatically. BIMI ties the logo to the domain's DMARC record, providing another level of visual assurance to recipients that the email is legitimate. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): DKIM is an email security standard designed to make sure that messages were not altered in transit between the sending and recipient servers. It uses digital signatures linked to the domain of the sender to verify the sender and ensure message integrity. SPF (Sender Policy Framework): SPF is an email authentication method designed to prevent email spoofing. It specifies which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of a domain by creating a DNS record. This helps protect against spam by providing a way for receiving mail servers to check that incoming mail from a domain comes from a host authorized by that domain's administrators.</p> \n  <h6>Use Cases</h6> \n  <p>This information is helpful for researchers as it helps assess a domain's email security posture, uncover potential vulnerabilities, and verify the legitimacy of emails for phishing detection.

width=\"800\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Here’s the twist that breaks brains:</p>\n\n<p>When you “log in” with Google, you’re <strong>not using OAuth alone</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>You’re using <strong>OpenID Connect (OIDC)</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>OIDC is an <strong>identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>OAuth says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This app may access this resource.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>OIDC adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“And here is who the user actually is.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Without OIDC, OAuth does not authenticate humans.<br />\nIt authorizes software.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  How JWT, OAuth, and OIDC Actually Work Together\n</h2>\n\n<p>This is the real-world flow most systems use, even if they don’t realize it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>User authenticates via OIDC</li>\n<li>Authorization server validates identity</li>\n<li>An <strong>access token</strong> is issued</li>\n<li>That access token is often a <strong>JWT</strong>\n</li>\n<li>APIs verify the JWT signature locally</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>JWT becomes the <strong>container</strong>.<br />\nOAuth defines <strong>who may receive it</strong>.<br />\nOIDC defines <strong>who the user is</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This is not redundancy.<br />\nThis is layering.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Access Tokens vs Refresh Tokens (Where Many Breaches Begin)\n</h2>\n\n<p>Not all tokens are equal.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access tokens</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>short-lived</li>\n<li>sent with every request</li>\n<li>frequently JWTs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n<li>\n\n<p><strong>Refresh tokens</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>long-lived</li>\n<li>never sent to APIs</li>\n<li>used only to obtain new access tokens</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>If your refresh token leaks, you have a real problem.</p>\n\n<p>If your access token leaks, expiry limits the blast radius.</p>\n\n<p>Security is about <strong>containing damage</strong>, not preventing mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  When JWT Alone Is Enough\n</h2>\n\n<p>JWT-only authentication is reasonable when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>you control the entire system</li>\n<li>users don’t need third-party login</li>\n<li>permissions are simple</li>\n<li>tokens expire quickly</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is common in:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>internal tools</li>\n<li>early-stage products</li>\n<li>mobile apps with a single backend</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>JWT shines in closed worlds.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  When OAuth/OIDC Is Worth the Pain\n</h2>\n\n<p>OAuth and OIDC earn their keep when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>users expect social login</li>\n<li>multiple clients exist (web, mobile, partners)</li>\n<li>APIs are exposed externally</li>\n<li>access must be scoped and revocable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OAuth is not overengineering.<br />\nIt’s <em>honest engineering</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Persistent Myths That Refuse to Die\n</h2>\n\n<p><strong>“JWT is more secure than OAuth”</strong><br />\nThey solve different problems. Stop comparing them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“OAuth replaces JWT”</strong><br />\nOAuth frequently uses JWT as its token format.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“JWT payloads are private”</strong><br />\nThey are readable. Assume visibility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>“Stateless means simpler”</strong><br />\nStateless means fewer knobs when things go wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Mental Model That Actually Works\n</h2>\n\n<p>If nothing else sticks, let this one stick:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>JWT</strong> → how claims are packaged</li>\n<li>\n<strong>OAuth</strong> → who may access what</li>\n<li>\n<strong>OIDC</strong> → who the user is</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once you separate those layers, the noise fades.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Final Thought: Security Is Memory\n</h2>\n\n<p>Security systems are not about clever code.<br />\nThey are about remembering past decisions under pressure.</p>\n\n<p>JWT remembers claims.<br />\nOAuth remembers permissions.<br />\nOIDC remembers identity.</p>\n\n<p>Confusion happens when we forget <em>why</em> each one exists.</p>\n\n<p>Clarity is not optional here.<br />\nIt’s the difference between a clean audit and a long incident report.</p>\n\n<p>And incident reports are never written at pleasant hours.</p>\n\n<p>Read on Medium : <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dulthiwanka2015/jwt-vs-oauth-why-everyone-argues-and-almost-everyone-is-slightly-wrong-0f77469491ec?postPublishedType=initial\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medium Article</a></p>",

        "title": "Clone Graph: Coding Problem Solution Explained",
        "summary": "<h1>\n  \n  \n  Clone Graph\n</h1>\n\n<p>The “Clone Graph” problem asks you to create a deep copy of a connected graph. Each node in the graph contains a value and a list of its neighbors. The cloned graph must contain entirely new nodes, but it must preserve the exact structure of the original graph, including all connections and cycles. In other words, every node and edge relationship in the original graph must be mirrored in the clone, without reusing any original objects.</p>\n\n<p>This problem is not about copying values in isolation. It is about duplicating relationships. The real challenge lies in correctly recreating the graph’s topology, especially when cycles and shared neighbors are involved.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why naive copying fails\n</h2>\n\n<p>A naive approach might try to recursively copy each node and its neighbors. This quickly breaks down when the graph contains cycles. Without careful handling, the algorithm can fall into infinite recursion, repeatedly trying to clone the same nodes.</p>\n\n<p>Another common mistake is duplicating nodes multiple times. If two nodes in the original graph both reference the same neighbor, the clone must also reference a single cloned version of that neighbor, not two separate copies. Failing to preserve this one-to-one correspondence leads to an incorrect graph structure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://dev.to/stack_overflowed/island-perimeter-coding-problem-solution-4adg\">Island Perimeter</a> coding problem solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Recognizing the need for a mapping\n</h2>\n\n<p>The key insight in this problem is that cloning a graph is fundamentally about maintaining a mapping between original nodes and their cloned counterparts. Every time you clone a node, you must remember that clone so you can reuse it later if the original node is encountered again.</p>\n\n<p>This mapping serves two purposes. First, it prevents infinite loops when the graph contains cycles. Second, it ensures structural consistency by guaranteeing that each original node corresponds to exactly one cloned node.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Graph traversal as the foundation\n</h2>\n\n<p>To clone a graph, you must visit every node and inspect its neighbors. This naturally leads to graph traversal techniques such as depth-first search or breadth-first search. Either traversal strategy works, as long as you systematically explore all reachable nodes.</p>\n\n<p>During traversal, the mapping is checked first. If the current node has already been cloned, you simply return the existing clone. If not, you create a new clone, store it in the mapping, and then proceed to clone its neighbors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://dev.to/stack_overflowed/sum-of-left-leaves-coding-problem-explained-i56\">Sum of Left Leaves</a> and <a href=\"https://dev.to/stack_overflowed/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range-coding-problem-solution-ah7\">Bitwise AND of Numbers Range</a> coding problem solutions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why depth-first and breadth-first both work\n</h2>\n\n<p>Depth-first search tends to be conceptually simple because it mirrors the recursive definition of a graph. You clone a node, then recursively clone its neighbors. Breadth-first search, on the other hand, processes nodes level by level using a queue.</p>\n\n<p>Both approaches are correct because the mapping ensures that each node is cloned exactly once, regardless of traversal order. The choice between them is mostly a matter of style and comfort.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Handling cycles safely\n</h2>\n\n<p>Cycles are what make this problem interesting. In a cyclic graph, you can revisit the same node through different paths. Without the mapping, this would cause infinite recursion or repeated cloning.</p>\n\n<p>With the mapping in place, cycles become harmless. When a previously visited node is encountered again, the algorithm simply retrieves its clone from the mapping and links to it. This preserves the cycle structure perfectly in the cloned graph.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Building neighbor relationships correctly\n</h2>\n\n<p>Cloning nodes alone is not enough. You must also rebuild each node’s neighbor list. This is done by iterating through the original node’s neighbors and attaching the corresponding cloned neighbors to the cloned node.</p>\n\n<p>Because neighbors may or may not have been cloned yet, this step relies on recursive calls or queued traversal steps. The mapping ensures that neighbor references always point to the correct cloned objects.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why this approach guarantees correctness\n</h2>\n\n<p>Correctness comes from two guarantees. First, every original node is visited and cloned exactly once. Second, every original edge is recreated between the corresponding cloned nodes.</p>\n\n<p>Because the mapping enforces one-to-one correspondence and traversal ensures full coverage, the cloned graph is structurally identical to the original, with no shared references between them.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Time and space complexity considerations\n</h2>\n\n<p>The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the number of nodes and edges, because each node and each edge is processed once. Space complexity is also linear, driven by the mapping and the recursion stack or traversal queue.</p>\n\n<p>This efficiency is optimal for graph cloning, as you cannot clone fewer nodes or edges than exist in the original graph.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why this problem is common in interviews\n</h2>\n\n<p>Clone Graph is a classic interview problem because it tests whether candidates truly understand graph traversal and object copying. It exposes misunderstandings about shallow versus deep copies and highlights the importance of handling cycles correctly.</p>\n\n<p>The problem also checks whether candidates can manage auxiliary data structures, such as mappings, to preserve relationships during traversal.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What this problem teaches beyond graph cloning\n</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond this specific task, the problem teaches a broader lesson about duplicating interconnected data structures. Whenever objects reference each other, cloning requires tracking identity, not just values.</p>\n\n<p>If you can clearly explain why a mapping is essential, how traversal explores the graph safely, and how cycles are handled without special cases, you demonstrate strong algorithmic reasoning. That depth of understanding makes “Clone Graph” an excellent exercise in graph traversal, memory management, and deep-copy semantics.</p>\n\n<p>If you want more coding problems explained, check out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/stack_overflowed/balanced-binary-tree-solution-explained-2773\">Balanced Binary Tree</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/stack_overflowed/boats-to-save-people-coding-problem-explained-3j3h\">Boats to Save People</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dev.to/stack_overflowed/find-duplicate-subtrees-solution-explained-1mof\">Find Duplicate Subtrees</a></li>\n</ul>",

Tailwind CSS was chosen to create a clean, responsive, and consistent UI while allowing rapid iteration and customization.</p>\n\n<p>From a design perspective, I focused on simplicity, usability, and scalability—keeping the interface minimal while ensuring smooth user interaction and clear visual hierarchy. Components were structured to be reusable and maintainable, following best practices in modern frontend development.</p>\n\n<p>For AI integration, I embedded the Google Gemini API to enhance functionality with intelligent, context-aware responses. This allowed the application to demonstrate real-world AI usage, combining frontend performance with powerful generative AI capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, my development process emphasized modular architecture, performance optimization, and seamless AI integration, resulting in a polished and future-ready application.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  What I'm Most Proud Of:\n</h2>\n\n<p>I’m most proud of successfully integrating Google’s Gemini API into a modern React application and making AI feel both accessible and practical within a clean user experience. Turning a powerful generative AI tool into something intuitive for users was a key achievement.</p>\n\n<p>From a technical standpoint, I’m proud of the performance and structure of the application—using ViteJS for fast builds, React component reusability, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, visually consistent design. The project maintains a good balance between functionality and simplicity.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also proud of the overall development workflow, from planning the UI and component architecture to embedding AI features in a scalable way. This project represents my growth as a developer and my ability to combine modern frontend technologies with real-world AI integration to build meaningful, future-ready applications.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\" href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzgsg80ye34kwtrt861b0.png\"><img alt=\"My Portfolio\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fzgsg80ye34kwtrt861b0.png\" width=\"800\" /></a></p>",

Frames are grouped in a way that allows efficient compression, indexing, and parallel reads.</p> \n<p>This frame-based design enables:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Append-only writes without modifying or corrupting existing data</li> \n <li>Queries over past memory states</li> \n <li>Timeline-style inspection of how knowledge evolves</li> \n <li>Crash safety through committed, immutable frames</li> \n <li>Efficient compression using techniques adapted from video encoding</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The result is a single file that behaves like a rewindable memory timeline for AI systems.</p> \n<hr /> \n<h2>Core Concepts</h2> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Living Memory Engine</strong> Continuously append, branch, and evolve memory across sessions.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Capsule Context (<code>.mv2</code>)</strong> Self-contained, shareable memory capsules with rules and expiry.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Time-Travel Debugging</strong> Rewind, replay, or branch any memory state.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Smart Recall</strong> Sub-5ms local memory access with predictive caching.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Codec Intelligence</strong> Auto-selects and upgrades compression over time.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<hr /> \n<h2>Use Cases</h2> \n<p>Memvid is a portable, serverless memory layer that gives AI agents persistent memory and fast recall.

        "title": "Early-Career Software Development: A Production-Oriented View",
        "summary": "<p>Software development looks different once you are working inside systems that already exist, already serve users, and already carry risk. Early-career developers tend to notice this gap quickly, even if they cannot yet name it.</p>\n\n<p>The observations here come from working across multiple teams and production environments over several years. The patterns are consistent. They repeat regardless of stack, company size, or domain.</p>\n\n<p>This is a reflection on how software is actually built and maintained, and how early-career developers are usually evaluated within that reality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Context and Audience</strong></p>\n\n<p>Early-career developers are generally in their first two to four years of professional work. Some entered the field through traditional education. Others arrived through career changes. Once inside a team, those differences fade.</p>\n\n<p>Most work happens in established systems. The codebase predates the developer. Decisions have history. Some context is missing. Much of it exists only in the code itself.</p>\n\n<p>Developers contribute alongside others, under deadlines, with incomplete information. They operate within processes that existed before they joined and will continue after they leave. The environment is shared, persistent, and constrained.</p>\n\n<p>From the outside, this can look disorganized. From the inside, it is routine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technologies: What Changes and What Persists</strong></p>\n\n<p>Early in a career, technologies feel central. Languages, frameworks, tools. They are visible and easy to compare.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, most of them rotate over time.</p>\n\n<p>What changes quickly sits near the surface. Libraries, frameworks, conventions, and tooling respond to fashion and convenience.</p>\n\n<p>What persists sits underneath. Execution models. Data flow. State management. Failure behavior. These concerns resurface across stacks.</p>\n\n<p>Languages matter less than the paradigms they promote. Frameworks matter less than the boundaries they impose. Those boundaries are costly to revise.</p>\n\n<p>Experienced engineers tend to judge tools by the constraints they introduce, not by their advertised strengths. How change happens. How failure appears. How safely work moves into production. These questions remain stable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problems Early-Career Developers Often Underestimate</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most professional time is not spent writing new code. It is spent reading existing code and understanding why it exists in its current form.</p>\n\n<p>Large codebases are accumulations. They reflect trade-offs made under pressure, sometimes years apart. They are not internally consistent stories.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements are rarely complete. They shift. They conflict. Decisions still have to be made.</p>\n\n<p>Legacy systems restrict what is possible. Some limits are technical. Others are organizational. Many cannot be addressed directly.</p>\n\n<p>Time pressure is not unusual. It is constant. Work proceeds with partial information because delay has consequences.</p>\n\n<p>Production issues make this tangible. Signals are noisy. Causes are unclear. Fixes are often provisional. Stability takes priority.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Skills Rarely Taught Explicitly</strong></p>\n\n<p>Debugging in real systems is about narrowing uncertainty. It is not about locating a single mistake. It is about ruling out possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>Logs and metrics are fragments of behavior. They arrive late and tell incomplete stories. Interpreting them improves with repetition.</p>\n\n<p>Version control becomes a coordination problem long before it becomes a technical one. Errors spread quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Communication shapes outcomes. Code reviews, written decisions, and problem descriptions affect how work flows through a team. Ambiguity slows progress.</p>\n\n<p>Code reading dominates daily work. The ability to infer intent from structure and usage patterns grows quietly over time. Many developers recognize this late.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Senior Engineers Tend to Evaluate Junior Developers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Correctness is assumed. It is the baseline.</p>\n\n<p>What stands out is clarity. What problem is being addressed. Why a particular approach was chosen. Whether constraints were understood.</p>\n\n<p>Solutions are judged in context. A technically impressive change that increases operational risk is not necessarily an improvement.</p>\n\n<p>Feedback patterns matter. How input is received. How it is applied. These signals accumulate.</p>\n\n<p>Clear communication reduces risk. Precise questions. Direct explanations. Timely updates. These behaviors build trust.</p>\n\n<p>Evaluation is rarely about isolated moments. It is about whether someone can make reasonable decisions without constant oversight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Long-Term Thinking, Applied Early</strong></p>\n\n<p>Fundamentals hold their value. Data movement, error handling, and system boundaries remain relevant as tools change.</p>\n\n<p>Writing down decisions helps more than expected. It clarifies thinking and preserves context. Even minimal notes reduce future confusion.</p>\n\n<p>Learning how to assess new tools matters more than learning them quickly. Calm evaluation scales better than urgency.</p>\n\n<p>Maintainability is concrete. Code will be read under pressure, often by someone without the original context.</p>\n\n<p>Impact accumulates slowly. So do the costs of change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Software engineering is a long practice. Progress comes from repeated exposure to constraints, not from avoiding them.</p>\n\n<p>Production systems make trade-offs unavoidable. They favor clarity, restraint, and consistency over novelty.</p>\n\n<p>Tools will change. Teams will change. Systems will age.</p>\n\n<p>What remains is judgment. How problems are framed. How decisions are made with limited information. How work holds up over time.</p>",
