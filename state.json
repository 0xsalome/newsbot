They found that the thalamus plays a decisive role in maturing the cortex and organizing its neural networks. Signals from the thalamus triggered synchronized activity in specific neuron types, while others remained unaffected. The system closely mimics human brain development and could transform how scientists study neurological disorders.",

        "title": "The creator of Claude Code just revealed his workflow, and developers are losing their minds",
        "summary": "<p>When the creator of the world&#x27;s most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn&#x27;t just listen — it takes notes.</p><p>For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177\">thread on X</a> from <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny\">Boris Cherny</a>, the creator and head of <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview\">Claude Code</a> at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a>. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup.</p><div></div><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you&#x27;re behind as a programmer,&quot; wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/jefftangx\">Jeff Tang</a>, a prominent voice in the developer community. <a href=\"https://x.com/KyleMcnease/status/2007555584724480338\">Kyle McNease</a>, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny&#x27;s &quot;game-changing updates,&quot; Anthropic is &quot;on fire,&quot; potentially facing &quot;their ChatGPT moment.&quot;</p><p>The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny&#x27;s workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny&#x27;s setup, the experience &quot;<a href=\"https://x.com/mtwichan\">feels more like Starcraft</a>&quot; than traditional coding — a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.</p><p>Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. </p><h2><b>How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game</b></h2><p>The most striking revelation from Cherny&#x27;s disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional &quot;<a href=\"https://notes.paulswail.com/public/The+inner+and+outer+loops+of+software+development+workflow\">inner loop</a>&quot; of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.</p><p>&quot;I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal,&quot; Cherny wrote. &quot;I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input.&quot;</p><p>By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs &quot;5-10 Claudes on <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">claude.ai</a>&quot; in his browser, using a &quot;teleport&quot; command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.</p><p>This validates the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/03/anthropic-daniela-amodei-do-more-with-less-bet.html\">do more with less</a>&quot; strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.</p><h2><b>The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model</b></h2><p>In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic&#x27;s heaviest, slowest model: <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5\">Opus 4.5</a>.</p><p>&quot;I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything,&quot; Cherny <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179838864666847\">explained</a>. &quot;It&#x27;s the best coding model I&#x27;ve ever used, and even though it&#x27;s bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it&#x27;s better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end.&quot;</p><p>For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn&#x27;t the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI&#x27;s mistakes. Cherny&#x27;s workflow suggests that paying the &quot;compute tax&quot; for a smarter model upfront eliminates the &quot;correction tax&quot; later.</p><h2><b>One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson</b></h2><p>Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not &quot;remember&quot; a company&#x27;s specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.</p><p>To address this, Cherny&#x27;s team maintains a single file named <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179842928947333\">CLAUDE.md</a> in their git repository. &quot;Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time,&quot; he wrote.</p><p>This practice transforms the codebase into a self-correcting organism. When a human developer reviews a pull request and spots an error, they don&#x27;t just fix the code; they tag the AI to update its own instructions. &quot;<a href=\"https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2007347705945944153\">Every mistake becomes a rule</a>,&quot; noted <a href=\"https://x.com/aakashgupta\">Aakash Gupta</a>, a product leader analyzing the thread. The longer the team works together, the smarter the agent becomes.</p><h2><b>Slash commands and subagents automate the most tedious parts of development</b></h2><p>The &quot;vanilla&quot; workflow one observer praised is powered by rigorous automation of repetitive tasks. Cherny uses slash commands — custom shortcuts checked into the project&#x27;s repository — to handle complex operations with a single keystroke.</p><p>He highlighted a command called <i><b>/commit-push-pr</b></i>, which he invokes dozens of times daily. Instead of manually typing git commands, writing a commit message, and opening a pull request, the agent handles the bureaucracy of version control autonomously.</p><p>Cherny also deploys subagents — specialized AI personas — to handle specific phases of the development lifecycle. He uses a code-simplifier to clean up architecture after the main work is done and a verify-app agent to run end-to-end tests before anything ships.</p><h2><b>Why verification loops are the real unlock for AI-generated code</b></h2><p>If there is a single reason Claude Code has reportedly hit <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone\">$1 billion in annual recurring revenue</a> so quickly, it is likely the verification loop. The AI is not just a text generator; it is a tester.</p><p>&quot;Claude tests every single change I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension,&quot; Cherny wrote. &quot;It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works and the UX feels good.&quot;</p><p>He argues that giving the AI a way to verify its own work — whether through browser automation, running bash commands, or executing test suites — improves the quality of the final result by &quot;2-3x.&quot; The agent doesn&#x27;t just write code; it proves the code works.</p><h2><b>What Cherny&#x27;s workflow signals about the future of software engineering</b></h2><p>The reaction to Cherny&#x27;s thread suggests a pivotal shift in how developers think about their craft. For years, &quot;AI coding&quot; meant an autocomplete function in a text editor — a faster way to type. Cherny has demonstrated that it can now function as an operating system for labor itself.</p><p>&quot;Read this if you&#x27;re already an engineer... and want more power,&quot; <a href=\"https://x.com/jefftangx/status/2008246873275215890\">Jeff Tang</a> summarized on X.</p><p>The tools to multiply human output by a factor of five are already here. They require only a willingness to stop thinking of AI as an assistant and start treating it as a workforce. The programmers who make that mental leap first won&#x27;t just be more productive. They&#x27;ll be playing an entirely different game — and everyone else will still be typing.</p>",

After decades of financial trouble, the iconic movie house closed during the pandemic. It reopened in 2023 under Tarantino’s ownership and has since re-established itself as a premiere moviegoing destinations. </p>\n<p>First opened by businessman Louis Bard in 1923, Vista Theater—originally called Bard’s Hollywood Theatre—was one of several Los Angeles movie houses built in Lewis Arthur Smith’s signature Spanish Revival style. Though the film industry was still nascent, Bard sought to capitalize on the growing demand for silent pictures, building a small chain of Egyptian-themed theaters across Hollywood and Los Feliz. Inside, the theater’s walls are lined with glowing Egyptian figureheads, inspired by the worldwide excitement over the excavation of King Tut’s tomb the year before its opening.</p>\n<p>Just a few years later, however, Louis Bard faced financial troubles and sold the theater in 1927. Over the following few decades, ownership transferred many times, and the theater became entangled in controversy. In 1948, the theater showed the highly controversial and notoriously racist film “The Birth of a Nation,” which was met with opposition and protests. A decade later, at the height of the Cold War, the theater drew controversy again for showing what some critics described as “pro-Communist” Soviet films.</p>\n<p>Towards the turn of the century, the theater struggled to maintain business and survived mainly as a local venue for weddings and showing smaller, independent screenings for local filmmakers. It officially closed in 2020 but was quickly revived a few years later, aided by a substantial renovation that preserved its original design while modernizing its interior.</p>\n<p>Since its reopening, the Vista Theater has committed to only project movies on film, featuring both a 70mm and 35mm film projector. It is also among the few theaters in the world capable of projecting VistaVision, giving film enthusiasts the rare opportunity to view VistaVison films in their original widescreen horizontal format. Originally developed by Paramount Pictures in the 1950s, VistaVison has experienced a revival through popular filmmakers such as Paul Thomas Anderson and Christopher Nolan. Many claim VistaVison captures a film’s color with more vibrancy and clarity than a standard 35 or 70mm projection. </p>",

Serving the commuter rail, the orange line connecting to North Station, and a stop for Amtrak, there is no shortage of foot traffic. Within the waiting area for Amtrak departures, there is a large statue of a man in a sitting pose with informational guides posted nearby. Most commuters probably don’t notice it, but the man depicted played a significant role in shaping worker’s rights and civil rights during the 20th century. </p>\n<p>Asa Philip Randolph was born in Crescent City, Florida on April 15, 1889. His family moved to Jacksonville, Florida in 1891 and growing up in the South, Randolph witnessed Jim Crow firsthand and learned from his parents the importance of education, self-defense, character, and conduct. He attended the Cookman Institute in East Jacksonville and graduated as the valedictorian for the class of 1907. Randolph read W.E.B. Du Bois’ book <em>The Souls of Black Folk,</em> which convinced him to become a fighter for social equality. However, with all jobs except manual labor off limits for African Americans, Randolph moved to New York City in 1911. </p>\n<p>Shortly after arriving in New York, Randolph helped organize the Shakespearean Society in Harlem and became involved in many socialist political movements. In 1917, he and fellow activist Chandler Owen founded the magazine <em>The Messenger </em>which advocated against lynching, US participation in World War I, fighting for a more integrated society, and for Black Americans to join unions. In the early 1920s, Randolph ran for local government offices on the socialist platform but was unsuccessful. In 1925, he founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first labor union led by Black Americans to receive a charter in the American Federation of Labor. Randolph campaigned extensively for workers of the Pullman Company, a manufacturer of railroad cars and a major employer of African Americans at the time. After the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Pullman Company began to negotiate with the Brotherhood and settled on a contract in 1937 which guaranteed higher wages, overtime pay, and a shorter workweek. </p>\n<p>In addition to labor unions, Randolph also worked extensively for civil rights in the United States. He worked closely with President Roosevelt during the Second World War to address racial discrimination in the war industry and to ensure Black Americans had the equal opportunity to serve their country. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in June 1941 which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry and the government backed Black workers during the Philadelphia Transit Strike in 1944. After the war, Randolph continued to work with the next administration and in 1948, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981 which abolished segregation in the US military. Once the Civil Rights Movement began in the 1950s, Randolph was a key figure and formed an important alliance with Martin Luther King Jr. in 1957. On August 28, 1963, Randolph was one of the leaders during the March on Washington where King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech which had a significant impact on the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. </p>\n<p>On May 16, 1979, Randolph passed away inside his Manhattan apartment. On October 8, 1988, a group of retired Pullman car porters and dining car waiters gathered at Back Bay station to unveil a statue dedicated to Randolph who worked so hard on their behalf decades ago. The sculpture is located within a waiting area with many plaques and informational signs posted. If you would like to learn more about Randolph, his life, and his contributions, it’s definitely worth taking a look next time you’re at Back Bay station. </p>",

It is likely one of the only ancient keyhole mound tombs of a Japanese emperor which one can actually walk around and climb. This is because when it was identified as the probable tomb of Emperor Keitai, the Imperial Household Agency had already assumed that he was buried in another location. As such, they declined to award protection to the tomb, which today remains under the stewardship of the local government.</p>\n<p>For many years until its excavation and conversion into a park, Imashirozuka Kofun was in a very neglected state. Its primary mound has partially collapsed, which was thought to be because the warlord Oda Nobunaga built a castle on it in the 16th century. In reality, the collapse occurred because of an earthquake in 1596, according to archaeologists.</p>\n<p>Commonly found among kofun tombs of the 3rd through 6th centuries are haniwa, terracotta figures used as funerary objects. Cylindrical haniwa were used to support the kofun mounds, and haniwa shaped as people, objects, animals, or houses were placed on top of or around the mounds. They were likely supposed to play a role in protecting or housing spirits of the deceased. Imashirozuka Kofun is unique among such sites in having an actual reconstruction of such a ritual precinct of haniwa, similar to the army of terracotta warriors in front of Emperor Qin Shi Huang's tomb in China.</p>",

It would be more accurate to refer to this structure as the Mausoleum or Shrine of Moulay Tayeb Al-Darqawi, however, on most maps, it is commonly identified simply by his name. This could be considered an odd detail of negligible importance, but there is another peculiar fact pertaining to this site: although there is a wealth of documentation regarding his father, there is virtually no information at all on Moulay Tayeb Al-Darqawi apart that he was his father’s successor as the head of the Darqawiyya order in Morocco. This is basically an obscure misnamed shrine honouring an obscure person. </p>\n<p>Another significant reason why this shrine is little-known is that it is located in the Rif Region, which is a sparsely populated rural area with limited public transport – only shared taxis come this way. It is only 135 km north of <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/fez-morocco\">Fez</a>, but the route mainly consists of narrow, crumbling roads winding up and down this section of the Middle Atlas. With no major settlements nearby, this shrine stands out in the middle of farmland. This shrine was erected in this particular place because the Al-Darqawi family was originally form the Rif Region. </p>\n<p>The shrine exhibits all the typical characteristics of shrines in the region.  The base is rectangular, and it is capped with a dome roof that symbolises the heavens. Along the perimeter of the dome are decorative crenelations, which are also quite widespread.  Large sections of the plaster that once covered the whole shrine peeled off, revealing red bricks and earth. The cracks and other signs of natural wear suggest that this shrine was been neglected for quite a long time. </p>\n<p>The inside of the shrine is equally dilapidated, but there are still some elements of interest. The floor and part of the lower walls are still covered with traditional Moroccan tiles called <em>zellige</em>. Light enters primarily from the main arched door and the two sizable windows on its sides. Opposite, there are two more small windows with the shutters closed. The inside of the dome reveals the intricate brinkmanship that went into this structure.  Visible is also a delicately decorated fragment of plaster on the domed ceiling, all the remains of <em>tadelakt</em> (polished lime plaster) that probably covered the whole ceiling.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amnous.net/?p=37071\">Restoration work</a> of Moulay Tayeb Al-Darqawi was planned to start in 2020. Since then, the dirt road linking the shrine to the main road has been improved, and the outer wall around the shrine was demolished, however, as of 2025, there is no sign of further restoration work. The construction warning sign is still standing but so faded that it is basically unreadable. </p>",

The store is still family-operated to this day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside, an impressive rug room boasts 1,500 handcrafted Native American rugs for sale; over a thousand leather saddles are also available, as are animal products like buckskins and deerskins. Aisles are stocked full of one-of-a-kind turquoise, coral, and silver jewelry crafted by local artisans and unique pottery from seven different pueblos, tribes, and nations in the area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The light-up sign outside Richardson’s is a landmark in its own right, as a perfect encapsulation of the neon style beloved by Route 66 enthusiasts. It </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reads “RICHARDSON CASH PAWN” and indeed, many of the items inside are not technically for sale but “for pawn”—referring to a historic Navajo trading practice that emerged as members of the Navajo Nation struggled to find banks that would accept them as customers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, they would offer goods to local trading posts and receive small cash loans in return. Pawnshops served a dual purpose for the Navajo people: a holding facility for valuable goods as well as a means of accessing credit when money was tight. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bill Richardson’s father, the founder of Richardson’s, didn’t turn a profit on his pawn operation, instead allowing the Navajo people to use his establishment as a reliable banking system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Richardson’s is an iconic establishment for those who pass through Gallup as well as for local residents, dedicated to selling authentic handmade goods from New Mexico’s Native communities.</span></p>",

(After Vanderbilt’s death, his widow sold about 86,000 acres of the land to the U.S. Forest Service to create the Pisgah National Forest.) The forest on the land is thought to be the first professionally managed forest in the country, and the Biltmore School of Forestry, established at the turn of the 20</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> century, was the nation’s first such institution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Biltmore continues to be an attraction for visitors to the region, and in 1986, the North Carolina General Assembly formally established the arboretum as an affiliate of the </span><a href=\"https://www.northcarolina.edu/institution/the-north-carolina-arboretum/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of North Carolina System</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to complete the legacy that Olmsted and Vanderbilt envisioned.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The arboretum does a great job of incorporating Appalachian culture into the landscapes,” says North Carolina Arboretum's Abby Cantrell</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “The Quilt Garden features seasonal plantings that represent traditional quilting patterns; the Heritage Garden is filled with plants traditionally used for things like broom making, dyeing yarn, and other heritage crafts.\" She notes that the Bonsai Exhibition Garden reflects the climate of Western North Carolina, which puts a unique twist on the art of Bonsai. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The arboretum boasts 10 miles of trails, which can provide an all-day activity or just a brief, accessible trail walk. </span></p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2025, the Arboretum launched the \"North Carolina Tree of the Year\" initiative, selecting the White Oak (</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quercus alba</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) as its inaugural honoree. More than 10,000 trees on the Arboretum lands were lost during Hurricane Helene in 2024, and the white oak will feature heavily on future reforesting efforts in the area.</span></p>",

This church, whose origins date back to the 13th century, boasts a remarkable collection of intricately carved bench ends depicting an array of designs, from biblical scenes to mythical creatures. These carvings offer a glimpse into the cultural and religious symbolism of the era and are a delight for art enthusiasts and history fans, inviting visitors to explore the stories etched into the wood over 700 years ago.</p>\n<p>The knight effigies within its walls add to its historical allure. These effigies commemorate local knights who played influential roles in the region's history. Adorned in full armour, these figures are a reminder of the church's connection to the local gentry. The effigies are meticulously detailed, from the chainmail to the solemn expressions on the knights' faces, providing a tangible link to the past and sparking the imagination of those who ponder the lives of these ancient warriors.</p>\n<p>One of the more intriguing features of St. John the Baptist Church is its squint, a small aperture in the wall that allowed worshippers to view the altar from a side chapel. This architectural element, also known as a \"hagioscope,\" was designed to enable those who were unable to be in the main body of the church, such as lepers or penitents, or those who didn't wish to worship with the main crowd, like the gentry, to still participate in the Mass.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

The town offers a highland climate where summer temperatures rarely exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit, providing a cool sanctuary for locals from warmer lowland regions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The town’s identity is anchored by “<a href=\"https://theblowingrock.com/\">The Blowing Rock</a>,” an immense cliff overhanging the Johns River Gorge. The formation's unique geometry creates a vertical flume of wind that can blow light objects back up to the clifftop. This phenomenon inspired a famous Cherokee and Catawba legend of two star-crossed lovers: a brave who leapt from the rock into the gorge only to be blown back into the arms of his maiden by a gust of wind. Today, it remains one of the state’s oldest and most popular travel attractions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the legend, Blowing Rock serves as a cultural hub for this region of the state known as the High Country. Its downtown features walkable streets lined with boutiques, fine art galleries, and acclaimed restaurants like the <a href=\"https://blowingrock.com/blowing-rock-ale-house/\">Blowing Rock Ale House</a>.

The carriage trails there offer great “mountain immersion,” she notes, from the easy Figure 8 walk near the Cones's house to the climb up Flat Top Mountain with its firetower and epic views. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those in the mood for a vista with less effort, head to Thunder Hill Overlook on the Blue Ridge Parkway,” says Lugenbell, noting that the views are particularly beautiful at sunset. </span></p>\n<p>There’s no shortage of activities for winter sports enthusiasts, with three nearby winter resorts plus <a href=\"https://appskimtn.com/\">Appalachian Ski Mountain</a> right in Blowing Rock. “When it snows the town becomes a wonderland,” says Lugenbell. “Blowing Rock gets all decked out in twinkling lights for the holiday season.” </p>\n<p>Annual events such as <a href=\"https://blowingrockwinterfest.com/\">WinterFest</a> (January) and <a href=\"https://blowingrock.com/artinthepark/\">Art in the Park</a> (May to October), as well as the unbeatable leaf-peeping window in October also draw visitors all year round.</p>",
