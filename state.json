Many of these hidden emissions can transform into fine particles that are dangerous to breathe. The study shows wildfire pollution rivals human-made emissions in some parts of the world. This helps explain why wildfire smoke can linger and worsen air quality long after the flames are gone.",

Even patients who stayed on GLP-1 drugs for a full year saw much smaller results than surgical patients. High dropout rates and real-world challenges appear to blunt the drugs’ effectiveness.",

They found that the thalamus plays a decisive role in maturing the cortex and organizing its neural networks. Signals from the thalamus triggered synchronized activity in specific neuron types, while others remained unaffected. The system closely mimics human brain development and could transform how scientists study neurological disorders.",

Some people inherited the virus directly in their DNA, passing it down across generations. The study shows that these viruses evolved alongside humans—and that one strain eventually lost its ability to integrate into our chromosomes. It’s the first time this long, intimate relationship has been proven with ancient genetic evidence.",

Additionally, these historic locations are simply more likely to be preserved if they are in places in the countryside that are less likely to be built over.</p>\n<p>In this sense, the Tarxien Temples in Malta are unusual because they sit in what is now a suburban area close to the nation’s capital. The temples were discovered in 1913 (during the time Malta was a British colony) by local farmer Lorenzo Despott before this part of Malta became urbanized. Since their discovery, the Tarxien Temples have been recognized as one of the most important Neolithic sites in the Maltese Islands.</p>\n<p>The Tarxien Temples are the largest surviving structures in Malta to have been built in the late Neolithic period (with the exact construction date being somewhere between 3600 and 2500 BC). The complex consists of four interlinked temples that were thought to be used for religious practices, including the sacrifice of animals, although in the Bronze Age, the site was repurposed as a cremation cemetery. Notably, the site features a substantial amount of bas-relief sculptures depicting spirals and animals.</p>\n<p>Since its discovery, the temples have been granted protection against their destruction even while the United Kingdom was expanding its military facilities around the nearby harbors during the latter part of Malta’s colonial era. The site is now managed by Heritage Malta and is now formally referred to as the Ħal Tarxien Prehistoric Complex. Additionally, in 2015, the site was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, underlining the importance of the site not only in terms of Malta’s history but also in terms of the history of the Mediterranean and of Europe.</p>",

After decades of financial trouble, the iconic movie house closed during the pandemic. It reopened in 2023 under Tarantino’s ownership and has since re-established itself as a premiere moviegoing destinations. </p>\n<p>First opened by businessman Louis Bard in 1923, Vista Theater—originally called Bard’s Hollywood Theatre—was one of several Los Angeles movie houses built in Lewis Arthur Smith’s signature Spanish Revival style. Though the film industry was still nascent, Bard sought to capitalize on the growing demand for silent pictures, building a small chain of Egyptian-themed theaters across Hollywood and Los Feliz. Inside, the theater’s walls are lined with glowing Egyptian figureheads, inspired by the worldwide excitement over the excavation of King Tut’s tomb the year before its opening.</p>\n<p>Just a few years later, however, Louis Bard faced financial troubles and sold the theater in 1927. Over the following few decades, ownership transferred many times, and the theater became entangled in controversy. In 1948, the theater showed the highly controversial and notoriously racist film “The Birth of a Nation,” which was met with opposition and protests. A decade later, at the height of the Cold War, the theater drew controversy again for showing what some critics described as “pro-Communist” Soviet films.</p>\n<p>Towards the turn of the century, the theater struggled to maintain business and survived mainly as a local venue for weddings and showing smaller, independent screenings for local filmmakers. It officially closed in 2020 but was quickly revived a few years later, aided by a substantial renovation that preserved its original design while modernizing its interior.</p>\n<p>Since its reopening, the Vista Theater has committed to only project movies on film, featuring both a 70mm and 35mm film projector. It is also among the few theaters in the world capable of projecting VistaVision, giving film enthusiasts the rare opportunity to view VistaVison films in their original widescreen horizontal format. Originally developed by Paramount Pictures in the 1950s, VistaVison has experienced a revival through popular filmmakers such as Paul Thomas Anderson and Christopher Nolan. Many claim VistaVison captures a film’s color with more vibrancy and clarity than a standard 35 or 70mm projection. </p>",

        "summary": "<p>In the heart of Idaho, about 150 miles east of Boise, the steep slopes of Bald Mountain tower over a sun-kissed valley. For roughly a century, visitors have flocked to Sun Valley from all over the country for its premiere skiing and snowboarding. But behind these sought-after slopes, there’s an impressive history and one-of-a-kind cultural experiences that make it a unique destination.</p>\n<p>Hollywood’s most celebrated stars have traveled to the valley for decades, yet Sun Valley has managed to maintain a laid-back local life and spirit even amid such A-list appeal. That rare blend of low-pretension modernity—coupled with nonstop flights from eight major metropolitan areas, including Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles—make Sun Valley a low-stress, culture-packed getaway.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106264/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\">A History of Innovation</h2>\n<p>Long before the glistening snow and sun-soaked days helped launch Sun Valley into a skier's dreamland, a sparkle of another sort caught national attention: silver. In the 1870s, the first discoveries of the precious metal attracted prospectors from across the nation.</p>\n<p>An anchor of the region, the <a href=\"https://visitsunvalley.com/lodging/sun-valley-lodge/\">Sun Valley Resort</a>, with slopes that cater to beginners and seasoned veterans in equal measure, has hosted some of the most iconic stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.</p>\n<p>But it was born in part out of necessity: The Great Depression hit the railroad business hard in the region. In 1936, Averell Harriman, the chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad at the time, had the idea to boost traffic on its lines by building an exclusive European-style destination ski resort. At the time there were virtually no U.S. ski areas that had upscale lodging and dining right at the slopes.</p>\n<p>To add to the must-see appeal, the resort unveiled the first-ever chairlift on nearby Proctor Mountain. The brainchild of James Curran, an engineer with the railroad, its inspiration came from a surprising place: bananas. While traveling in tropical regions, Curran had seen bananas hooked in bunches and hauled to the dock by pulley systems. Why not try the same with people?</p>\n<p>That December, “Life Magazine” featured the new technology, which helped position the resort as a go-to getaway. The lift, which moved skiers 20 feet off the ground for more than 3,500 feet with a 1,150-foot gain in elevation, opened up the sport to people who might not have otherwise had the stamina for the activity.</p>\n<p>Cinema’s elite, including Marilyn Monroe, Ingrid Bergman, Frank Sinatra and Clark Gable, stayed at the resort, and Ernest Hemingway, whose <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ernest-hemingway-s-grave\">burial site</a> is also in Sun Valley, finished “For Whom the Bell Tolls” in suite 206 of the Sun Valley lodge. More recently, the region has also attracted business elites and tech giants like Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Apple CEO Tim Cook.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106260/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\">Laid-Back Local Vibe</h2>\n<p>Today in Sun Valley Village, the walkable heart of the resort, that glamorous essence is anchored by an affable vibe and crowd-pleasing activities. The 1937 opera house now serves as a movie theater, which features films by snow and skiboard filmmaker Warren Miller, among other classics. Ice skating enthusiasts may want to check out the <a href=\"https://visitsunvalley.com/searching-for-sun-valley/get-to-know-every-ice-rink-in-the-wood-river-valley/\">Sun Valley ice rink</a>, a known hangout for Olympic athletes as they prepare for the popular Sun Valley on Ice shows. And additional dining, shopping, and entertainment options abound in nearby Ketchum, located less than two miles down the road (which also has its own free outdoor ice rink, open from late December until mid-February).</p>\n<p>Dining in Sun Valley can be as cosmopolitan or low-key as your tastes crave. For a rustic, homestyle pick, <a href=\"https://www.kneadery.com\">The Kneadery</a> in North Ketchum serves up hearty breakfast and lunch dishes and has been a local go-to since 1974. Owners Dillon and Heather Witmer have cultivated an impressive collection of Western art and artifacts for decades, and diners will spot a canoe hanging from the dining room ceiling, while a taxidermied grizzly bear and mounted antlers on wood-paneled walls add to the cozy, lodge-like feel.</p>\n<p>For a contemporary option be sure to check out Cookbook, which offers flavor-packed bites ranging from grilled Idaho trout to house-made pesto and inventive pizzas. The restaurant, which was originally located in a 1932 church but has since moved to a larger location, serves up plenty of vegetarian options as well, and is commended by guests for its great service and family friendly atmosphere.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img alt=\"article-image\" class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/106259/image.jpg\" width=\"auto\" /></figure>\n<h2 class=\"article-subheading-pre-rd\">Vibrant Off-Slope Culture</h2>\n<p>Even if you never hit the slopes, Sun Valley is full of high-quality, even quirky, cultural experiences all year long. The <a href=\"https://visitsunvalley.com/to-do/sun-valley-museum-of-art/\">Sun Valley Museum of Art</a> in Ketchum is a regional hub for contemporary and local art, formed in 1971.

Screenings, cocktail and coffee chats, and big-ticket parties honor the greatest names in film and introduce emerging artists. Monthly movies and educational programming are also offered year-round.</p>\n<p>Each January, respected culinary masters and rising food stars emerge at the <a href=\"https://visitsunvalley.com/events/sun-valley-food-wine-celebration-2/\">Sun Valley Food &amp; Wine Celebration</a>.

Serving the commuter rail, the orange line connecting to North Station, and a stop for Amtrak, there is no shortage of foot traffic. Within the waiting area for Amtrak departures, there is a large statue of a man in a sitting pose with informational guides posted nearby. Most commuters probably don’t notice it, but the man depicted played a significant role in shaping worker’s rights and civil rights during the 20th century. </p>\n<p>Asa Philip Randolph was born in Crescent City, Florida on April 15, 1889. His family moved to Jacksonville, Florida in 1891 and growing up in the South, Randolph witnessed Jim Crow firsthand and learned from his parents the importance of education, self-defense, character, and conduct. He attended the Cookman Institute in East Jacksonville and graduated as the valedictorian for the class of 1907. Randolph read W.E.B. Du Bois’ book <em>The Souls of Black Folk,</em> which convinced him to become a fighter for social equality. However, with all jobs except manual labor off limits for African Americans, Randolph moved to New York City in 1911. </p>\n<p>Shortly after arriving in New York, Randolph helped organize the Shakespearean Society in Harlem and became involved in many socialist political movements. In 1917, he and fellow activist Chandler Owen founded the magazine <em>The Messenger </em>which advocated against lynching, US participation in World War I, fighting for a more integrated society, and for Black Americans to join unions. In the early 1920s, Randolph ran for local government offices on the socialist platform but was unsuccessful. In 1925, he founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first labor union led by Black Americans to receive a charter in the American Federation of Labor. Randolph campaigned extensively for workers of the Pullman Company, a manufacturer of railroad cars and a major employer of African Americans at the time. After the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Pullman Company began to negotiate with the Brotherhood and settled on a contract in 1937 which guaranteed higher wages, overtime pay, and a shorter workweek. </p>\n<p>In addition to labor unions, Randolph also worked extensively for civil rights in the United States. He worked closely with President Roosevelt during the Second World War to address racial discrimination in the war industry and to ensure Black Americans had the equal opportunity to serve their country. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in June 1941 which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry and the government backed Black workers during the Philadelphia Transit Strike in 1944. After the war, Randolph continued to work with the next administration and in 1948, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981 which abolished segregation in the US military. Once the Civil Rights Movement began in the 1950s, Randolph was a key figure and formed an important alliance with Martin Luther King Jr. in 1957. On August 28, 1963, Randolph was one of the leaders during the March on Washington where King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech which had a significant impact on the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. </p>\n<p>On May 16, 1979, Randolph passed away inside his Manhattan apartment. On October 8, 1988, a group of retired Pullman car porters and dining car waiters gathered at Back Bay station to unveil a statue dedicated to Randolph who worked so hard on their behalf decades ago. The sculpture is located within a waiting area with many plaques and informational signs posted. If you would like to learn more about Randolph, his life, and his contributions, it’s definitely worth taking a look next time you’re at Back Bay station. </p>",

It is likely one of the only ancient keyhole mound tombs of a Japanese emperor which one can actually walk around and climb. This is because when it was identified as the probable tomb of Emperor Keitai, the Imperial Household Agency had already assumed that he was buried in another location. As such, they declined to award protection to the tomb, which today remains under the stewardship of the local government.</p>\n<p>For many years until its excavation and conversion into a park, Imashirozuka Kofun was in a very neglected state. Its primary mound has partially collapsed, which was thought to be because the warlord Oda Nobunaga built a castle on it in the 16th century. In reality, the collapse occurred because of an earthquake in 1596, according to archaeologists.</p>\n<p>Commonly found among kofun tombs of the 3rd through 6th centuries are haniwa, terracotta figures used as funerary objects. Cylindrical haniwa were used to support the kofun mounds, and haniwa shaped as people, objects, animals, or houses were placed on top of or around the mounds. They were likely supposed to play a role in protecting or housing spirits of the deceased. Imashirozuka Kofun is unique among such sites in having an actual reconstruction of such a ritual precinct of haniwa, similar to the army of terracotta warriors in front of Emperor Qin Shi Huang's tomb in China.</p>",

It would be more accurate to refer to this structure as the Mausoleum or Shrine of Moulay Tayeb Al-Darqawi, however, on most maps, it is commonly identified simply by his name. This could be considered an odd detail of negligible importance, but there is another peculiar fact pertaining to this site: although there is a wealth of documentation regarding his father, there is virtually no information at all on Moulay Tayeb Al-Darqawi apart that he was his father’s successor as the head of the Darqawiyya order in Morocco. This is basically an obscure misnamed shrine honouring an obscure person. </p>\n<p>Another significant reason why this shrine is little-known is that it is located in the Rif Region, which is a sparsely populated rural area with limited public transport – only shared taxis come this way. It is only 135 km north of <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/fez-morocco\">Fez</a>, but the route mainly consists of narrow, crumbling roads winding up and down this section of the Middle Atlas. With no major settlements nearby, this shrine stands out in the middle of farmland. This shrine was erected in this particular place because the Al-Darqawi family was originally form the Rif Region. </p>\n<p>The shrine exhibits all the typical characteristics of shrines in the region.  The base is rectangular, and it is capped with a dome roof that symbolises the heavens. Along the perimeter of the dome are decorative crenelations, which are also quite widespread.  Large sections of the plaster that once covered the whole shrine peeled off, revealing red bricks and earth. The cracks and other signs of natural wear suggest that this shrine was been neglected for quite a long time. </p>\n<p>The inside of the shrine is equally dilapidated, but there are still some elements of interest. The floor and part of the lower walls are still covered with traditional Moroccan tiles called <em>zellige</em>. Light enters primarily from the main arched door and the two sizable windows on its sides. Opposite, there are two more small windows with the shutters closed. The inside of the dome reveals the intricate brinkmanship that went into this structure.  Visible is also a delicately decorated fragment of plaster on the domed ceiling, all the remains of <em>tadelakt</em> (polished lime plaster) that probably covered the whole ceiling.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amnous.net/?p=37071\">Restoration work</a> of Moulay Tayeb Al-Darqawi was planned to start in 2020. Since then, the dirt road linking the shrine to the main road has been improved, and the outer wall around the shrine was demolished, however, as of 2025, there is no sign of further restoration work. The construction warning sign is still standing but so faded that it is basically unreadable. </p>",
